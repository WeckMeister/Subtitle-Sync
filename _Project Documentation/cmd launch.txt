More improvements for V2:

Add a menu at the top to see properties of all the files selected
File Properties _
		Video
		Subtitle

so when i click on video submenu, a window appears with the video info, same for subtitle submenu under File Properties

then for video, get the filename but also ffmpeg properties like type of file, screen ratio etc

for subtitle display the name, date created etc

extract the tv series season information from the filename , shownameS01E23 = season 1 episode 23
file size, location etc for both (maybe try to link with information in related nfo files in file directory)

After running sync, Provide options to display the generated files in the panes - either whisper or final synced 

Then add option of clicking on a line to edit or delete it, 

then add ability to run the final sync using the edited files without redoing the whisper transcription

in fact, provide ability to import / select as previously generated whisper file and subtitle file and compare them to sync after edits

so , basically need the ability to perform a sync without requiring whisper transcribing before i sync two files.

also, when we select a file, try to add an optional filter to filter out episode numbers so i see only related files when filtered


Ah yes, that’ll do it! Without that subfolder, PyInstaller couldn’t find the expected models/whisper-large-v3/ dir
