1
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:02,480
Hey, good morning.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:02,980
Hey.

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,599
When did you finally come to bed?

4
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,219
Because I thought you were coming right up,

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,140
but then I fell asleep.

6
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:09,240
Yeah, the game.

7
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,279
We went into double overtime.

8
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:11,259
It was amazing.

9
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:11,720
Oh.

10
00:00:12,659 --> 00:00:15,039
Because I thought we had plans.

11
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:18,019
Sorry.

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,440
God.

13
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,820
Did you catch the end of that game?

14
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,679
Oh, it was amazing.

15
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:23,199
See?

16
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,219
All right.

17
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:26,820
Well, I'll let you boys talk about your exciting sports.

18
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,120
I just hope there's not a game on tonight.

19
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,260
Good night.

20
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:35,200
Huh.

21
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:36,140
What?

22
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,359
I think she just gave me the look.

23
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:42,060
What do you mean?

24
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:43,520
You know.

25
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:49,159
Sex.

26
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,219
That face means sex?

27
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,240
I thought it meant gas.

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,039
She does it better, okay?

29
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,100
Yeah, I know when Amy's in the mood,

30
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:05,739
because she always gives me this sexy little sideways smile.

31
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,060
Yeah.

32
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,480
Yeah.

33
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,260
I think Amy's saying,

34
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,659
hurry up and get it over with.

35
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:21,040
Your mother's got a look, too,

36
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,359
which is why after sunset I avoid all eye contact.

37
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,400
It's weird, though.

38
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:31,939
It's weird.

39
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:33,620
Okay.

40
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,780
Last night I got the look.

41
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,099
But I got caught up in the game,

42
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:40,060
so I stayed up to watch it instead of going upstairs.

43
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:42,180
And now, instead of being mad,

44
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:43,599
Deborah gave me the look again.

45
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:44,659
Huh.

46
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,060
Maybe...

47
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,299
Maybe I should turn her down again, you know?

48
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:54,340
Why would you do a silly thing like that?

49
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:55,359
I don't know.

50
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:57,680
I mean, I'm always the one being shot down.

51
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,099
It felt good.

52
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,019
I could hurt wondering where I was last night.

53
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,819
You can't turn her down.

54
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:05,040
I-I could, too, turn her down.

55
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:05,780
Oh, come on.

56
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:06,579
You'll follow her around

57
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:07,920
like a dog with his tongue hanging out.

58
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:11,479
Yeah, your tongue is the leash she uses

59
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,919
to parade you around the park.

60
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,300
Ladies and gentlemen,

61
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,419
worst in show.

62
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,740
Yeah, well, then maybe that's why I should turn her down,

63
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,300
so she doesn't take me for granted.

64
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:24,039
You know?

65
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:26,159
I mean, she's got to appreciate what she's got here.

66
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,360
Yes.

67
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,259
She's got to catch.

68
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:33,139
I can hardly keep my hands off you.

69
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:41,860
Hey.

70
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:47,580
Hey.

71
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:51,740
Oh.

72
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,400
I left the hallway light on.

73
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,319
I'll be right back.

74
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:05,759
I can see no.

75
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:06,740
I can say no.

76
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,639
You all ready to sleep?

77
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:25,699
Uh-uh.

78
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:26,280
Ah.

79
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,879
Uh-oh.

80
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:28,099
Oh.

81
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:28,280
Oh.

82
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:29,099
Oh.

83
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:30,379
You must be tired.

84
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,419
Oh, yeah.

85
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,599
I'm kind of beat.

86
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:38,240
You know, I just, I got a lot of stuff going on.

87
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,060
Maybe tomorrow.

88
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,120
Really?

89
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:48,180
Yeah.

90
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,639
Okay.

91
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,039
Okay.

92
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,639
Well, night.

93
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:58,060
Yeah.

94
00:03:58,819 --> 00:03:59,680
Good night.

95
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:12,340
Wait, wait, man.

96
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:12,699
Come on.

97
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,039
Let's go.

98
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,400
I don't think I'm going to go hit balls today.

99
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:16,319
What?

100
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,480
Oh, why?

101
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,800
Did the wife say you can't go?

102
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,060
No, no.

103
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:21,639
Just a little stiff.

104
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,240
That's all.

105
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:23,519
Oh.

106
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,939
So it's a medical decision you're making

107
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:28,040
to stay here?

108
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:28,839
To stay here and...

109
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,120
Help Amy pick out drapes.

110
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,360
Ah, drapes.

111
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:35,660
Yeah.

112
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,800
Well, if there's any material left over,

113
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,899
why don't you make yourself a little skirt?

114
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,959
I'm still going to go.

115
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,639
And you know what?

116
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,959
I may go tomorrow because I can do whatever I want.

117
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,300
What do you mean?

118
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,060
All right.

119
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:55,879
You thought I couldn't turn down Debra, right?

120
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,339
Two times, my friend!

121
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,620
Yeah, last night I told her

122
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,959
that I had a lot of work to do today.

123
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:01,980
Work.

124
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:05,740
And then, and then, first thing this morning,

125
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:06,759
she started hinting again.

126
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,060
She even brushed her teeth and everything.

127
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:09,899
But...

128
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:11,180
No sale!

129
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:12,500
Oh, it's amazing.

130
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,339
It's like, it's like, every time I turn it down,

131
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,439
she seems to want it more.

132
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,639
She's like a guy.

133
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,339
Huh.

134
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,740
But she's not getting upset?

135
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:23,519
No, no, no.

136
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,300
That's just it.

137
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,240
She's been treating me better all day.

138
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,399
I came down this morning.

139
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,040
She was making me a check.

140
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,660
Cheese omelette.

141
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:31,139
I mean, she hasn't done that since before Allie was born.

142
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,379
I mean, yeah, it had shells in it, but still.

143
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,160
You know what I've discovered?

144
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,300
The power of no.

145
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:42,959
Oh, the power of no.

146
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,680
Give me a break.

147
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:44,680
Hey, hey, hey.

148
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,100
Who gets to hit a bucket of balls in the middle of the day?

149
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,439
Yeah, well, that's just the difference

150
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,519
between me and you, Raymond.

151
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,139
You know, you like to golf by yourself

152
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,240
and have a crappy omelette while I prefer sex.

153
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:02,740
No, man, you're not getting it.

154
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,480
Deborah can't keep her hands off me.

155
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,139
It's like with the power of no

156
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:08,199
comes the power of yes.

157
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,199
Uh-huh.

158
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,980
For the first time in my marriage,

159
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,000
I finally know what it's like

160
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,399
to be the one wearing the panties.

161
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,100
You have a wrong

162
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,879
and generally troubled relationship.

163
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,600
No, no, no, no, no, no, I don't.

164
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,420
It's very right.

165
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,540
But let me ask you something.

166
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,699
Why do you always feel the need

167
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:31,939
to be manipulative when it comes to sex?

168
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,579
Because I'm not very good at it.

169
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,839
Not very good at what?

170
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,920
Oh, you name it.

171
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,319
Hey, listen, Robert, he can't go hit balls,

172
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,600
but I was thinking that I'd still go.

173
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:44,680
Yeah, sure, go. Have a good time.

174
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:44,980
All right.

175
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,220
Hey, you know what?

176
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,600
They got a great hot dog guy there.

177
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,519
You want me to bring you back one?

178
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,220
No, I shouldn't.

179
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,079
I got to watch my figure.

180
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:00,920
Hey, you let me be the one to watch your figure.

181
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,160
Let me watch your figure?

182
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:08,779
That's not funny.

183
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,759
That's right, it's not, and yet it is.

184
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,839
Because she is weak.

185
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,980
Weak for my physique.

186
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,100
Oh, don't those look nice?

187
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:51,560
Yeah.

188
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,699
I don't know why Robert had such a hard time

189
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:54,540
putting them up yesterday.

190
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,399
Well, he can't handle normal things.

191
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,040
He can't handle normal-sized tools

192
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,540
with those giant fingers.

193
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,720
Here, push that curtain over a little

194
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,040
so we don't see his blood.

195
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,199
So what do you think, Deb?

196
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,860
Yeah, they look great.

197
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,879
Deborah, dear, you're being so quiet.

198
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,060
That's not like you.

199
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,519
No, I'm fine.

200
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,319
It's just...

201
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,980
Do I look different to you?

202
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:23,959
What do you mean?

203
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,199
I don't know.

204
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:26,019
I'm just feeling...

205
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:28,920
Have I drooped?

206
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,080
Drooped?

207
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,240
No, you try to work out and take care of yourself,

208
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,600
and yet there still comes a day when everything just...

209
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,559
I wouldn't know about that.

210
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,419
Oh, stop it, Deb.

211
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,179
You look great.

212
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,039
You know how my friends and I keep fit?

213
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,419
Water aerobics at the Y.

214
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,539
Say, why don't you come with us tomorrow?

215
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,960
Oh, well, I'll have to check and see if I'm free.

216
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,440
Oh, we'll have a ball.

217
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,100
Let me go look for an extra pair of nose clips

218
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,539
and a swim cap.

219
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:18,360
Deb, are you really upset about this?

220
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,220
Ray keeps turning me down.

221
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:26,980
What do you mean?

222
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,340
Sex?

223
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,139
That doesn't sound like him.

224
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,980
He usually follows you around with his tongue hanging out.

225
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,399
I know.

226
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,200
I'm sure it's not you.

227
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,159
Hey, maybe he's sick.

228
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:40,779
Nah.

229
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,580
I wish he was.

230
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,799
Oh, man.

231
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,659
Who am I kidding?

232
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,460
I should just go with Marie to the Y,

233
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,080
put on a flowery swim cap,

234
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,740
and float around with the old ladies.

235
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,700
Hey, you know,

236
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,120
it's funny you bringing this up,

237
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,440
because last night, when Robert and I went to bed,

238
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,279
he was acting kind of distant, too.

239
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:03,259
But then I just kissed his neck,

240
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,679
and he said, Ray's crazy.

241
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:08,440
He did?

242
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:09,399
Yeah.

243
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:12,639
And then he said something about how I could have all the power.

244
00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:14,340
It was weird.

245
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,240
Yeah, he usually doesn't like to mention Ray in the bedroom.

246
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,240
He says it inhibits him.

247
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,480
The power?

248
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,059
I mean, why would he...

249
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:30,720
What?

250
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:34,799
Oh, my God.

251
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,759
Oh, my God.

252
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:39,100
He has been turning me down on purpose.

253
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:40,659
Oh, no.

254
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:41,679
Why would he do that?

255
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,379
For the power.

256
00:10:45,859 --> 00:10:48,500
He thinks it gives him the upper hand or something.

257
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,899
Well, that's gross.

258
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,019
Hey, but look on the bright side.

259
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,899
This means you're still hot.

260
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,080
Of course I am.

261
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,620
You know what the worst part about this is?

262
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,360
That it worked.

263
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,840
I've been trying to make myself look better for him.

264
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:04,899
Do you know I did 138 sit-ups this morning,

265
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,320
all for some guy whose stomach looks like a deflated clown balloon.

266
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:11,480
Oh, boy.

267
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,820
You're going to kill him, aren't you?

268
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,799
No.

269
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:15,659
No.

270
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:17,340
I want him alive.

271
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,240
Hey, Jimmy Jack.

272
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:28,960
Hey.

273
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,539
How was work?

274
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,360
Good.

275
00:11:31,539 --> 00:11:32,220
Where are the kids?

276
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,259
I sent them over to the Parker's.

277
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:35,039
Why?

278
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,740
I wanted them out of the house.

279
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,240
Oh, yeah?

280
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,879
I didn't think it would be appropriate for the children to see what I was going to do

281
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:44,200
to you.

282
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,480
Oh, gosh.

283
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,340
Really, Deb?

284
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,159
Right now, I don't know.

285
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,120
I mean, I got a lot to do.

286
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,460
Really, Deb.

287
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,000
I think...

288
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,460
You're just so powerful.

289
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:02,759
Yeah.

290
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:03,379
Yeah.

291
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:03,860
Well...

292
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,799
I just can't resist a man with so much power.

293
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,500
Okay.

294
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:09,759
Look.

295
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,340
I'm really starting to feel a little uncomfortable.

296
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:11,759
Ah!

297
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,419
What's with you?

298
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,860
Robert told Amy why you've been turning me down.

299
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,820
I hate that guy.

300
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,600
Oh.

301
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,740
So you were just toying with me?

302
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:29,860
Getting me to beg for sex?

303
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:31,240
That makes you feel good?

304
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:31,720
No.

305
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,960
No, I don't know.

306
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:33,379
I just...

307
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:37,220
I guess I wanted to see what it was like to be the one being pursued for once.

308
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:39,899
But you made me feel terrible about myself.

309
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,360
You just kept rejecting me.

310
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:42,860
How could you do that to somebody?

311
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,220
What?

312
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:50,259
You had me convinced I was a fat, ugly old lady.

313
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,720
Well, now you know how I feel.

314
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,200
You feel bad because I turned you down what?

315
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:55,759
Three times?

316
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,740
Try being rejected 40 or 50 times every year for the last 10 years.

317
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:01,179
How do you think that feels?

318
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:03,759
You're looking at the president of the fat, ugly old lady's club.

319
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:05,720
Welcome.

320
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:06,500
Have a donut.

321
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:10,759
There is no way I turn you down that much.

322
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,299
And I say yes a lot.

323
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:12,759
Exactly.

324
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:14,399
You say yes and you say no.

325
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,539
You're the bouncer in front of the disco who decides who gets in and who doesn't.

326
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,480
And for once it was you standing outside.

327
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:20,960
Yeah.

328
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:22,159
And you couldn't take it.

329
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,539
Yeah.

330
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,639
It's cold out there, isn't it?

331
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,200
Standing in the rain with your bad shirt and your acne pimples.

332
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:31,480
There is no way you can compare me turning you down with what you did to me.

333
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,000
Listen, Ray.

334
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:36,039
If I turn you down, it is because I am exhausted from taking care of three kids all day and

335
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:37,779
thinking of everything that I have to do the next day.

336
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:40,580
Still using the kids, huh?

337
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:44,639
Oh, my God.

338
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,559
I can't believe I ever wanted to have sex with you.

339
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:50,759
Yeah, well, you don't have to worry because I'm not sure the next time you're getting

340
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:51,519
sex from me.

341
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:52,080
Oh.

342
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:55,419
You're threatening me with no sex, please.

343
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:57,000
Yeah, you will be saying please.

344
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,299
Pretty please with sugar on top.

345
00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm serious.

346
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,460
I don't know when I'll be in the mood again.

347
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,559
You are always in the mood.

348
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,860
You wouldn't last a night.

349
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:10,179
I just did three nights, Lady Pantaloons.

350
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:12,240
Okay?

351
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,519
So we'll see who can't last.

352
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:15,539
Oh, my.

353
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,139
How will I ever resist my baser instincts?

354
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,059
Yeah.

355
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,340
I like that.

356
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,799
I like the Southern thing.

357
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:22,059
Yeah.

358
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,539
That'll be good when you come back saying pretty please with sugar on top.

359
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:40,700
Okay.

360
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,320
Well, good enough.

361
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:42,700
Oh.

362
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:43,379
Oh.

363
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:44,960
Oh.

364
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:45,840
Oh.

365
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:46,980
Oh.

366
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,000
Oh.

367
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,379
Oh.

368
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:49,620
Oh.

369
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,399
Oh.

370
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,559
Oh.

371
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,019
Oh.

372
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:55,519
Oh.

373
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
Oh.

374
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,100
Oh.

375
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,980
Oh.

376
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:10,559
Oh.

377
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:10,879
Oh.

378
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:11,000
Oh.

379
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:11,059
Oh.

380
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:15,539
Oh.

381
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,539
What's with all your lacy apparel?

382
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,200
Nothing.

383
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,580
It's just pajamas.

384
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,940
Good night.

385
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,519
Yeah.

386
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,659
Yeah, yeah, I'm a little tired, too.

387
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,019
Did you put oil on?

388
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,259
No.

389
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,960
It's just my natural juices.

390
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:40,360
What are you doing?

391
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:41,919
Me?

392
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,700
What, did you have my mom put your makeup on?

393
00:16:46,099 --> 00:16:47,840
No sex for you.

394
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,059
No sex for you.

395
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:52,059
No sex for you.

396
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,859
All right, you win!

397
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,500
What?

398
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,359
I give up.

399
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:21,660
I am officially asking you to please have some sex with me.

400
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,880
What are you talking about?

401
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:25,440
Our thing.

402
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,019
Our not-having-sex thing.

403
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:29,680
Are we still doing that?

404
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:35,740
Of course we're still doing it.

405
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:37,220
It's been 26 days of doing it.

406
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:38,539
Not doing it.

407
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,160
Sorry, I totally forgot.

408
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:44,940
Yeah, right.

409
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,559
I mean, I can't believe it, but really, I totally forgot.

410
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,420
Please.

411
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,039
You expect me to believe that you didn't realize

412
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,059
that we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we.

413
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:53,480
We went 26 days without having sex?

414
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,720
I've been really busy, you know,

415
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:03,980
the PTA fundraiser is coming up,

416
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:06,579
and I've just, I've just had a lot on my mind.

417
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:13,099
26 days.

418
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,579
You weren't even trying.

419
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,440
I'm trying.

420
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:21,799
Guess I was never really close to having the power.

421
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:22,200
Was I?

422
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,099
Sorry.

423
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:29,799
All this time, I, I thought you were doing

424
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:31,259
all those little things to torture me.

425
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:32,839
What things?

426
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,519
Oh, forget it.

427
00:19:36,099 --> 00:19:37,259
No, come on.

428
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,900
You know, like biting your lower lip

429
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,799
when you use the remote to change the channel.

430
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:42,859
I do that?

431
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,180
Yeah.

432
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,599
Or how about when you keep one of your legs

433
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,779
outside of the covers and the pajama rides up it?

434
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:51,539
It's just because I'm hot.

435
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:52,599
Yes, you are!

436
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:56,819
Even when you sleep, every so often,

437
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:58,140
you kind of sigh a little.

438
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:03,720
You haven't slept much lately, have you?

439
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,119
No.

440
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:07,279
Even now,

441
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:09,579
look at you,

442
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,420
with your hair like that,

443
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,799
sitting there in your

444
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,660
robe.

445
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,519
I'm a mess.

446
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:24,720
Yeah, well, I guess even when you're not trying,

447
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:25,380
it still works.

448
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:32,980
What?

449
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,859
What are you doing?

450
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,519
You just got a little of your power back.

451
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,140
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

452
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,460
Are you toying with me?

453
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:46,759
Because if you are,

454
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:48,759
I'm just going to start to cry.

455
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,140
I'm sorry.

456
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,700
I've been waiting for this for a long time, too, Ray.

457
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,380
And by the way,

458
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,500
it's been 27 days, not 26.

459
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,559
All right.

460
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:00,539
You're a jury.

461
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:04,859
Member.

462
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:06,660
Morning.

463
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:07,099
Morning.

464
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,059
Morning, kids.

465
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:11,099
What are you doing here?

466
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,579
Well, you live here.

467
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,039
No, no, no, no, no.

468
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,839
Hey, you guys can make breakfast yourself, right?

469
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,779
Because Daddy has to talk to Mom.

470
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:22,799
She'll call Mommy upstairs about something.

471
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:24,880
Eh?

472
00:21:28,639 --> 00:21:28,740
Eh.

473
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:36,660
Ah!

474
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:41,980
Ah!

475
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,920
Ah!

476
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,299
Ah!

477
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:45,279
Ah!

478
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,599
Ah!

479
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:46,680
Ah!

480
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:49,680
Ah!
