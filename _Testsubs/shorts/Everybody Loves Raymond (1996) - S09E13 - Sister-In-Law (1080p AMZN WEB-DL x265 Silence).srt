1
00:00:02,267 --> 00:00:04,833
- Aha.
[Door opens]

2
00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:06,633
- Hi, ray.
- Oh, hey.

3
00:00:08,267 --> 00:00:09,900
- Oh, Deb's not here;
She's out with the kids,

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,733
so I'm just...You know,
trying to make the best of it.

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,300
- Yeah.

6
00:00:18,867 --> 00:00:21,000
- Oh...oh, okay.

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,467
Yeah, I'm just gonna
watch the knick game,

8
00:00:24,467 --> 00:00:26,133
you know, and...

9
00:00:26,133 --> 00:00:27,800
Nothing else.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,567
- Great; Yeah, Robert called
and told me

11
00:00:29,567 --> 00:00:31,067
you guys were gonna
watch the game

12
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:32,533
when he got home from work,

13
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,133
so I thought I'd wait
for him over here.

14
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:37,567
Is that okay?
- Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah.

15
00:00:40,533 --> 00:00:44,233
So when did Robert say
he was gonna come home?

16
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:46,767
- About an hour.

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,200
Are you excited about
fondue date night?

18
00:00:59,967 --> 00:01:03,167
- What--what--what what?

19
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:05,367
- You guys are coming over
tomorrow night

20
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:08,400
for Amy's first annual
fondue night.

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,600
It's gonna be just
the three barone couples,

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,833
like a triple date.

23
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:14,367
- Hey...

24
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:17,700
Hey, a date with my parents.

25
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,200
- I know you think it's corny,
but it'll be fun, really.

26
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,200
Fondue date night.
- Yeah.

27
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,067
Yeah, fun.

28
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:27,133
You know what?

29
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:28,700
I'll talk to Robert about it

30
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,100
when he gets here
in 58 minutes.

31
00:01:33,633 --> 00:01:35,200
- Oh, may I?

32
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,700
- Oh. Oh, yeah.
- Thanks.

33
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,700
Oh, look, this one
looks like a heart.

34
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:54,633
So from now on,

35
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:57,100
that's where I'm buying
all my sweaters.

36
00:01:58,167 --> 00:02:00,000
- Hey!
- Hey, hey, there he is!

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,200
There he is!

38
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,800
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hello, there.

39
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,533
- Missed you.
- Yeah, what's up?

40
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:07,167
We've been waiting
an hour and 11 minutes.

41
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,933
- Amy, ma wanted me
to remind you that

42
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:11,933
you'll be making the salad
for the dinner tonight.

43
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:14,100
- Oh, I forgot.
I better go.

44
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,767
Darn.
- Yeah, damn it.

45
00:02:17,767 --> 00:02:19,133
- See you later, yogi.

46
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:24,600
And, ray, I'll see you
at fondue.

47
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,933
- Okay, yeah.

48
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:29,100
- She's such a cutie pie.

49
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,267
[Both groan]

50
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:32,067
Oh, it's
the second half already?

51
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:34,567
- Yeah, man, you're missing
some great basketball.

52
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,533
Actually, I kind of
missed some too.

53
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:42,867
I was--me and Amy,
we had a nice long...

54
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:45,667
Chat.

55
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:47,200
- All right,
that's really nice.

56
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,700
What did you guys
talk about?

57
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,033
- Oh, gosh, pretty much
everything, I think, yeah.

58
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:53,633
- Yeah, Amy's great, huh?

59
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:57,033
- Yeah, Amy's great.
She's great. Yeah.

60
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,767
Kind of like
a little lady chatterley.

61
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:07,100
- Lady chatterley?
- Yeah.

62
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,033
- What do you mean?

63
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:10,333
- Oh, you know,
like she always--

64
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,433
she always wants to know
how everybody is,

65
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:15,900
and she gets real excited
about fondue date night.

66
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,733
And she told me about
this interesting salesgirl

67
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:21,400
that sold her a sweater
and--and--and, you know,

68
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,133
whatever; It's all good stuff;
It's all good.

69
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:28,067
- Are you saying that
Amy talks too much?

70
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,467
- No, Robert, I love Amy.

71
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:39,100
- Wow, are you a liar.

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,433
You know,
I know what it is.

73
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:45,067
I got something good,
and you can't stand it.

74
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:46,300
You never could.

75
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,500
Remember when
I made that diorama

76
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,533
in Mr. Carolan's
history class?

77
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:50,733
- What?

78
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:53,300
- Everybody said
how great it was, everybody!

79
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,100
I won a prize, remember?

80
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,733
But you said it stunk.

81
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:01,767
- You had George Washington
fighting a dinosaur.

82
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:04,600
- It was a dragon, Raymond!

83
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:10,267
A dragon that represented
years of British tyranny!

84
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:13,133
Which just goes to show

85
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:15,133
how stupid you were
then and now.

86
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:16,400
- Robert, I didn't--

87
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,800
- everybody thinks
my wife is great.

88
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,133
Everybody!

89
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,067
So you have to tell me that
she's a lady chatterbox

90
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:27,367
who won't shut up?

91
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,800
I know how it goes.

92
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,200
Jealous ass.

93
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,767
- Come on--

94
00:04:34,767 --> 00:04:37,000
- jeal-ass!

95
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,433
Yes!

96
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:41,500
- Stop it! No!
Come on, don't go, Robert!

97
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,400
Stay! Come stay
and watch the game!

98
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,733
Come on.

99
00:04:45,733 --> 00:04:47,767
You want to say something bad
about my wife, you can!

100
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:50,100
I don't care!

101
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,633
Ah, come on!

102
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:53,767
Say it! Say it!

103
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:56,733
She's a bad cook,
and she's mean!

104
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:01,667
Hey, hi...One second,
one second.

105
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:03,700
And you may
think that, Robert.

106
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,467
You'd be dead wrong!

107
00:05:05,467 --> 00:05:07,600
Dead wrong!

108
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,133
Debra is a caring,
beautiful, skinny person!
