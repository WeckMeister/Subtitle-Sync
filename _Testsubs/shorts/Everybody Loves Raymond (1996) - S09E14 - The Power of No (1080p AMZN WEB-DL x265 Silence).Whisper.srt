00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hey, good morning.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hey.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
When did you finally come to bed?

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Because I thought you were coming right up,

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
but then I fell asleep.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Yeah, the game.

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We went into double overtime.

8
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It was amazing.

9
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Oh.

10
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Because I thought we had plans.

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Sorry.

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
God.

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Did you catch the end of that game?

14
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh, it was amazing.

15
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
See?

16
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
All right.

17
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Well, I'll let you boys talk about your exciting sports.

18
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I just hope there's not a game on tonight.

19
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Huh.

20
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What?

21
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I think she just gave me the look.

22
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What do you mean?

23
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You know.

24
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Sex.

25
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That face means sex?

26
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000

27
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000

00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:43,120
so i stayed up to watch instead of going upstairs and now instead of being mad deborah gave me the

80

last night you can't turn her down i could turn her down oh come on you'll follow her around like

00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:12,680
a dog with his tongue hanging out yeah your tongue is the leash she uses to parade you around the

84
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:21,819
park ladies and gentlemen worst in show yeah well then uh maybe that's why i should turn her down

85
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:24,240
so she doesn't take me for granted you know

86
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,600
