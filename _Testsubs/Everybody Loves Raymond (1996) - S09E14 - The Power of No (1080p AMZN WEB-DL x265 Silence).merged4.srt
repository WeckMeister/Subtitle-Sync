But let me ask you something.

136
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,240
to be manipulative when it comes to sex?

137
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,240
Because I'm not very good at it.

138
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,240
Because I'm not very good at it.

139
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,240
Not very good at what?

140
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,240
Not very good at what?

141
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,240
Hey, listen, Robert, he can't go hit balls,

That's right, it's not, and yet it is.

153
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,240
That's right, it's not, and yet it is.

154
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
Because she is weak.

155
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,240
Weak for my physique.

156
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,240
[Clattering]
Oh.

157
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240

161
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,240
Well, he can't handle normal-sized tools

162
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,240
with those giant fingers.

163
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
I don't know why Robert had such a

So what do you think, Deb?

166
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,240
Yeah, they look great.

167
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,240
Deborah, dear, you're being so quiet.

168
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,240
Deborah, dear, you're being so quiet.

169
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,240
That's not like you.

170
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,240
No, I'm fine.

171
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,240
Do I look different to you?

172
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
What do you mean?

173
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
What do you mean?

174
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,240
Have I drooped?

175
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,240
Drooped?

176
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,240
You know, you try to work out

177
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
and yet there still comes a day

178
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,240
[Mimics exploding sound]
when everything just...

179
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,240
I wouldn't know about that.

180
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,240
You know how my friends and I keep

181
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,240
You know how my friends and I keep

182
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,240
Water aerobics at the Y.

183
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,240
Say, why don't you come with us tomorrow?

184
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
I'll have to check and see if I'm

185
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
Oh, well, I'll have to check and see

186
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Let me go look for an extra pair

187
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
Oh, well, I'll have to check and see

188
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
Deb, are you really upset about this?

189
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,240
Ray keeps turning me down.

190
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,240
He usually follows you around with his tongue

191
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,240
Yeah.

192
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,240
He usually follows you around with his tongue

193
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
I know.

194
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,240
I'm sure it's not you.

195
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,240
I'm sure it's not you.

196
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
I should just go with Marie to the

197
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
I should just go with Marie to the

198
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
I should just go with Marie to the

199
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
I should just go with Marie to the Y,

200
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
I should just go with Marie to the

201
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,240
Hey, you know,

202
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,240
because last night when Robert and I went

203
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,240
he was acting kind of distant, too.

204
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,240
And then he said something about how I

205
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,240
and he said, Ray's crazy.

206
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,240
And then he said something about how I

207
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,240
And then he said something about how I

208
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,240
something about how I could have all the

209
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,240
It was weird.

210
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,240
Yeah, he usually doesn't like to mention Ray

211
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,240
And then he said something about how I

212
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,240
Oh, my God.

213
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,240
Yeah, he usually doesn't like to mention Ray

214
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,240
Oh, my God.

215
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,240
Oh, my God.

216
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,240
Oh, my God.

217
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,240
Oh, my God.

218
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,240
Oh, my God.

219
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
The power is in the upper hand or something.

220
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
The power is in the upper hand or

221
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
The power is in the upper hand or

222
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,240
Well, that's gross.

223
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
The power is in the upper hand or

224
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,240
You know, the worst part about this is

225
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,820
Do you know I did 138 sit ups

226
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,240
You know, the worst part about this is

227
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,240
the worst part about this is that it

228
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,240
I've been trying to make myself look better

229
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,820
Do you know I did 138 sit ups

230
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,820
this morning all for some guy whose stomach

231
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,820
all for some guy whose stomach looks like

232
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,879
Boy, boy.

233
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,279
You're gonna kill him, aren't you?

234
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,279
No.

235
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:29,120
Hey, Jimmy Jack.

236
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:29,120
Hey, Jimmy Jack.

237
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,419
Hey. How was work?

238
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,419
Hey. How was work?

239
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:43,100
I didn't think it would be appropriate for

240
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:35,139
I sent them over to the Parker's.

241
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:43,100
I didn't think it would be appropriate for

242
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:38,139
I wanted them out of the house.

243
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:43,100
I didn't think it would be appropriate for

244
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,139
to see what I was going to do

245
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,139
to see what I was going to do to you.

246
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:43,100
I didn't think it would be appropriate for

247
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:54,139
I mean, I got a lot to do.

248
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:54,139
I mean, I got a lot to do.

249
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,159
I just can't resist a man with so

250
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:04,159
Yeah, yeah, well...

251
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,159
I just can't resist a man with so

252
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:12,159
Okay, look, I'm really starting to feel a

253
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:12,159
[screams]
Okay, look, I'm really starting to feel a little uncomfortable.

254
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:19,139
What's with you?

255
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:22,139
Robert told Amy why you've been turning me

256
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:22,139
Robert told Amy why you've been turning me down.

257
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:28,159
So you were just toying with me?

258
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:38,159
to be the one being pursued for once.

259
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:40,159
But you made me feel terrible about myself.

260
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:36,159
I guess I wanted to see what it

261
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:36,159
I wanted to see what it was like

262
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:38,159
to be the one being pursued for once.

263
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:40,159
But you made me feel terrible about myself.

264
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:40,159
But you made me feel terrible about myself.

I guess I wanted to see what it

266
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:44,159
How could you do that to somebody?

267
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:50,139
You had me convinced I was a fat,

268
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:50,139
You had me convinced I was a fat,

269
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:56,139
bad because I turned you down, what, three

270
00:12:56,139 --> 00:12:58,159
Try being rejected 40 or 50 times every

271
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:00,159
for the last ten years.

272
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:10,159
no way I turn you down that much.

273
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:01,159
How do you think that feels?

274
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,159
You're looking at the president

275
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,159
Welcome. Have a doughnut.

276
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:10,159
There is no way I turn you down

277
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,159
Exactly. You say yes, and you say no.

Exactly. You say yes, and you say no.

279

You're the bouncer in front of the disco

who decides who gets in and who doesn't.

281
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:22,139
And for once, it was you standing outside.

282
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,159
Exactly. You say yes, and you say no.

283
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:24,139
Yeah, and you couldn't take it.

284

Standing in the rain with your bad shirt

285
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,159
Standing in the rain with your bad shirt

286
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:32,159
There is no way you can compare me

287
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:22,139
And for once, it was you standing outside.

There is no way you can compare me

00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:38,159
it is because I am exhausted from taking

Still using the kids, huh?

think I ever wanted to have sex with

I don't think I ever wanted to have

00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:42,159
that I have to do the next day.

Oh, you're threatening me with no sex, please.

Oh, you're threatening me with no sex, please.

I don't know when I'll be in the

You wouldn't last a night.

I don't know when I'll be in the

Okay, so we'll see who can't last.

Oh, my.

308
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:18,139
How will I ever resist my baser instincts?

309
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:18,139
How will I ever resist my baser instincts?

How will I ever resist my baser instincts?

That'll be good when you come back saying

Okay, well, good enough.

Are those silk?

You want a feel?

It's quite all right.

What's with all your lacy apparel?

Nothing.

Nothing.

Good night.

Good night.

No.

No.

Your makeup on?

What?

What?

337
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,140
I give up!

338
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,140
I am officially asking you to please

00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,140
What are you talking about?

00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,140
Our thing!

00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,140
Our not-having-sex thing!

342
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,140
Of course we're still doing it.

Of course we're still doing it.

It's been 26 days of doing it.

Not doing it!

346
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,140
Yeah, right!

347
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,140
You expect me to believe that you didn't

I can't believe it, but really,

I totally forgot.

that we went 26 days without having sex?

00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,140
little things to torture me.

362
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,140
What things?

363
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,140
Forget it.

364
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,140
when you use the remote to change the

365
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,140
one of your legs outside of the covers

366
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,140
when you use the remote to change the

367
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,140
when you use the remote to change the channel.

368
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,140
one of your legs outside of the covers

369
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,140
one of your legs outside of the covers

370
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,140
and the pajama rides up it?

371
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,140
every so often you kind of sigh a

372
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,140
every so often you kind of sigh a

373
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,140
every so often you kind of sigh a

374
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,140
[Sighs quietly]
every so often you kind of sigh a little.

375
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,140
every so often you kind of sigh a

376
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,140
You haven't slept much lately, have you?

377
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,140
Even now,

378
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,140
Even now,

379
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,140
look at you,

380
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,140
with your hair like that,

381
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,140
with your...

382
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,140
robe.

383
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,140
What a mess!

384
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,140
Yeah, well,

385
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,140
You just got a little of your power

386
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,140
You just got a little of your power

387
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,140
You just got a little of your power back.

388
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,140
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

389
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,140
You just got a little of your power

390
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,140
You just got a little of your power

391
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,140
You just got a little of your power

392
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,140
I've been waiting for this for a long

393
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,140
I've been waiting for this for a long

394
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,140
it's been 27 days, not 26.

395
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,140
Remember.

396
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,140
Remember.

397
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,140
Morning, kids.

398
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,140
Well, you live here.

399
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,140
No!

400
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,140
Hey, you guys can make breakfast yourself, right?

401
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,140
has to talk to Mommy upstairs about something.

402
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,140
Eh?

403
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,140
[Mumbles weakly]
Eh?
