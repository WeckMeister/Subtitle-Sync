1
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:02,759
Ha!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,660
Hi, Ray!

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:06,500
Oh, hey.

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,400
Oh, uh, Deb's not here.

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,660
She's out with the kids, so I'm just, you know,

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,480
trying to make the best of it.

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,019
Yeah.

8
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:17,980
Come.

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,179
Oh. Oh, okay.

10
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:23,300
Yeah.

11
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,600
I'm just gonna watch the Nick game, you know,

12
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,800
and, uh, nothing else.

13
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:29,780
Great.

14
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:31,820
Yeah, Robert called and told me you guys were gonna

15
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,799
watch the game when he got home from work, so I thought

16
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:35,439
I'd wait for him over here. Is that okay?

17
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:37,659
Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah.

18
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,240
All right.

19
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:43,939
So, so, uh, when did Robert say

20
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:44,859
he was gonna come home?

21
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:46,600
An hour.

22
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,659
Are you excited

23
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:56,719
about fondue date night?

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,200
Yeah.

25
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,219
What, what, what, what?

26
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,659
You guys are coming over tomorrow night

27
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:08,079
for Amy's first annual fondue night.

28
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:10,299
It's gonna be just the three of our own couples.

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,420
Like a triple date.

30
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:12,299
Hey.

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,879
Yeah, a date with my parents.

32
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,359
I know you think it's corny,

33
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,939
but it'll be fun. Really.

34
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,480
Fondue date night.

35
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,180
Yeah.

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,680
Yeah, fun.

37
00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:29,480
Talk to Robert about it

38
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,099
when he gets here in, uh, 58 minutes.

39
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,099
May I?

40
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:37,180
Oh. Oh, yeah.

41
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,840
Oh, look.

42
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,980
This one looks like a heart.

43
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,060
So from now on,

44
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,540
that's where I'm buying all my sweaters.

45
00:01:58,299 --> 00:01:58,739
Hey.

46
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,000
Hey, there he is.

47
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:00,739
There he is.

48
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,879
Hi, sweetie.

49
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:03,959
Missed you.

50
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:05,099
Yeah, what's up?

51
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,480
We've been waiting an hour and 11 minutes.

52
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:10,439
Uh, Amy, Ma wanted me to remind you

53
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,180
that you'll be making the salad for the dinner tonight.

54
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,259
Oh, I forgot.

55
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,120
I better go. Darn.

56
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,120
Yeah, damn it.

57
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,439
See you later, Yogi.

58
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:22,560
And, Ray, I'll see you at fondue.

59
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:25,319
Oh.

60
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,099
Okay, yeah.

61
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:29,360
This is such a cutie pie.

62
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:29,840
Yeah.

63
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,180
Oh, it's the second half already?

64
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,960
Yeah, man, you're missing some great basketball.

65
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:34,759
Yeah.

66
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,139
Actually, I kind of missed some, too.

67
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,360
I was, uh...

68
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,819
Me and Amy, we had a nice, long...

69
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,180
chat.

70
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:46,819
All right.

71
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:48,960
That's really nice. What did you guys talk about?

72
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:50,560
Oh, gosh, pretty much everything, I think.

73
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:50,979
Yeah.

74
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,219
Uh, Amy's great, huh?

75
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:55,659
Yeah, Amy's great. She's great.

76
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:56,419
Yeah.

77
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,620
She's kind of like a little Lady Chatterley.

78
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,800
Lady Chatterley?

79
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:07,659
Yeah.

80
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,520
What do you mean?

81
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,340
Oh, you know, like, she always wants to know

82
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,539
who everybody is, and she gets real excited

83
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:16,039
about fondue date night.

84
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,580
And she told me about

85
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,639
this interesting sales girl that sold her a sweater.

86
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,280
And, you know, whatever.

87
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:22,979
It's all good stuff.

88
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:23,580
It's all good.

89
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,599
Are you saying that Amy talks too much?

90
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:34,719
No, Robert, I love Amy.

91
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,240
Wow, are you a liar.

92
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:42,800
You know, I know what it is.

93
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:45,759
I got something good, and you can't stand it.

94
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,680
Oh, you never could.

95
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,580
Remember when I made that diorama

96
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,139
in Mr. Carolyn's history class?

97
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:50,620
What?

98
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,620
Everybody said how great it was.

99
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,219
Everybody!

100
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,199
I won a prize, remember?

101
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,020
But you said it stunk.

102
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,659
You had George Washington fighting a dinosaur.

103
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,060
It was a dragon, Raymond!

104
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,280
A dragon

105
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,039
that represented years

106
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,419
of British tyranny!

107
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,199
Which just goes to show

108
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,139
how stupid you were then and now.

109
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:16,560
Robert, I didn't...

110
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,019
Everybody thinks my wife is great.

111
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:18,360
Everybody!

112
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,379
So you have to tell me

113
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:26,540
that she's a lady chatterbox

114
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,439
who won't shut up?

115
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,500
I know how it goes.

116
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,339
Jealous ass.

117
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,639
Jealous!

118
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:37,279
Yes!

119
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,560
Stop it, no!

120
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,160
Come on, don't go, Robert, stay!

121
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,139
Stay and watch the game!

122
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:46,360
You want to say something bad

123
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,319
about my wife, you can.

124
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:48,019
I don't care.

125
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,600
Ah, come on!

126
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,379
Say it, say it!

127
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,939
She's a bad cook and she's mean!

128
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,079
Hey,

129
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,160
one second, one second.

130
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,860
And you may think that, Robert,

131
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,259
but you'll be dead wrong!

132
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:06,879
Dead wrong!

133
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,480
Deborah is a caring, beautiful,

134
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,360
skinny person.

135
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,480
So how's it going?

136
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,079
Look, I saved you this chip.

137
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,860
It looks like a heart.

138
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,379
Bye, honey!

139
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,399
I've been quiet all night.

140
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:46,879
Are you okay?

141
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:47,939
Yeah, I'm fine.

142
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,060
Everything okay with you?

143
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,379
Fine and dandy.

144
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,680
Oh, did I show you this sweater I got?

145
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,439
It's nice.

146
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:00,579
The sales girl I bought it from, Bridget,

147
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,639
she was so sweet and smart.

148
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,519
She's taking some time off of school

149
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,180
to make some money,

150
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:06,519
but I really hope she finishes

151
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,740
because she was really great.

152
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:09,300
And then you bought the sweater.

153
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:09,680
Got it, got it.

154
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,920
I'm sorry.

155
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,079
Actually, you know,

156
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,319
I kind of did have a bad day.

157
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,360
Oh? What happened?

158
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,579
Oh, nothing.

159
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,600
It's just like every other day,

160
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:23,240
dealing with the scum of the earth.

161
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:25,819
Well,

162
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:28,439
at least you get tomorrow off.

163
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:30,819
And then, hey,

164
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:32,180
fondue date night.

165
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,120
That'll be fun.

166
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:36,300
Do.

167
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,240
Yeah, you know,

168
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,120
I was thinking,

169
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,139
maybe fondue date night

170
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:44,879
is not such a good idea right now.

171
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:45,939
Really?

172
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,259
Everybody else is excited about it,

173
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:48,740
even Ray.

174
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,040
Why do you even bother with him?

175
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:54,680
I know he doesn't like to open up,

176
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,980
but little by little,

177
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,740
I think I'm cracking his shell.

178
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,079
You know what?

179
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,639
There's a sweet person inside.

180
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,120
Oh, listen,

181
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:10,240
I know you and Raymond

182
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,180
have had your problems.

183
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:12,879
He said you talk too much.

184
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:16,819
What?

185
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,699
He called you Lady Blabbermouth.

186
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,379
He did?

187
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,860
Look, Amy, I'm sorry.

188
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,120
I've known Raymond

189
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,060
for a long time,

190
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,360
and do you know

191
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,720
that he's been

192
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,519
Now that I think about it,

193
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,019
while we were talking this afternoon,

194
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,399
he did excuse himself to go

195
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,860
to the bathroom like five times.

196
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,639
I thought he had a tummy problem.

197
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,360
It's not his tummy.

198
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,420
He has no soul.

199
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,980
So he just wanted me to go away?

200
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,939
That is kind of...

201
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:08,579
Jerky.

202
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,480
I love you so much.

203
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,240
Oh, hey, you know, this is good.

204
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,579
Tomorrow night, more cheese for us.

205
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,279
No, no, everybody's coming.

206
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:27,160
I'm just not going to let Ray's opinion affect me.

207
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:28,839
Okay, good, good.

208
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:31,800
Hey, you know what?

209
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,539
Don't even talk to him.

210
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:36,179
In fact, just stay quiet all night.

211
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,039
We won't even give him a chance to think that way about you.

212
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:40,960
Huh?

213
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,659
Robert,

214
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:55,299
when I was just telling you my sweater story

215
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:57,240
and you told me to...

216
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,960
Was that because you think

217
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,519
I talk too much?

218
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,740
No, no.

219
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,940
That's because Raymond brought it up.

220
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:11,139
You know, and I didn't want him to think that he was right.

221
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:12,799
Because, you know, like you said,

222
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:13,679
jerky.

223
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,740
And I love this new sweater.

224
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,019
It's a great sweater.

225
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,220
Great story about the sweater.

226
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,820
I'm stealing that story!

227
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,419
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

228
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,580
Amy, Amy, wait, wait.

229
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,460
Amy!

230
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,980
The one time I get a word in.

231
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:47,679
Okay, we have two different kinds of cheeses

232
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:49,779
and the chocolate is for all the fruit.

233
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:52,120
Move it, lady, I'm going in.

234
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:54,659
Hello!

235
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,019
Oh, hi!

236
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,919
Oh, Amy, everything smells great.

237
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,279
That's what I said.

238
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:05,120
Marie, here is the garlic toast I made for dipping.

239
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,360
Oh, thank you.

240
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:07,740
Hey, man.

241
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,259
Listen, I began about before.

242
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,360
I'm sorry.

243
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:17,059
Oh, you don't have to apologize to me.

244
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,200
Ray, can I talk to you for a second?

245
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:29,759
Hey.

246
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,759
Sup, sis?

247
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,360
Listen, Ray.

248
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,039
Robert told me about what happened yesterday,

249
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,320
and I just want to let you know that you're right.

250
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,500
I should have realized you're just a guy,

251
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,460
and guys just want to relax and watch TV,

252
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,580
and I should have left you alone.

253
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:49,179
Amy, will you marry me?

254
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,440
Will you marry me?

255
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,100
You know, listen, Amy.

256
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:00,419
Oh, no, no, no, Ray.

257
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,080
I don't want things to be weird between us,

258
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,019
so I'm sorry.

259
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,879
Well, me too.

260
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:09,639
Great.

261
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,360
Yeah.

262
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,059
Let's sit and eat.

263
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,240
Okay, all right.

264
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,059
I don't mind if I fondue.

265
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,019
All right.

266
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,659
I'll get a cheese one.

267
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,120
Wait a minute!

268
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:25,120
That's it?

269
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,039
It's fine, Robert.

270
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:29,740
Let me get this straight.

271
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,919
Raymond insults you, but you get mad at me,

272
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,559
and then you apologize to him?

273
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,000
What, are you taking lessons from my mom?

274
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:40,440
Who I love?

275
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:46,379
What's going on?

276
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,759
I'll tell you what's going on.

277
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,940
Yesterday, poor Raymond had to watch a basketball game

278
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,620
while Amy dared to sit next to him,

279
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,679
and then the minute she leaves,

280
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,019
he tells me that she had the nerve to talk to him

281
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:57,799
about things that didn't interest him,

282
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,399
called her Boxy Chatterhead.

283
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,399
Why would you call Amy a Boxy Chatterhead?

284
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,080
It's Lady Chatterley.

285
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:08,980
It's from a book.

286
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,240
Oh, no, it's okay.

287
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,039
To be fair, Ray is a sports writer.

288
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,940
It's kind of like I was bothering him at work.

289
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,940
Oh, Amy.

290
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,559
No.

291
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,379
No, Ray doesn't work.

292
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,799
Apologize to Amy right now.

293
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:25,259
Excuse me, this is between me and Amy,

294
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:27,120
and we're fine with it.

295
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,639
Amy, kudos on the fondue.

296
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,899
This is not between you and Amy.

297
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,220
What, are you kidding me?

298
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:40,980
You never listen, ever.

299
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,720
Never ever.

300
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,279
Oh, don't try to lay it on Ray, Robert.

301
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,019
Last night, you made it very clear

302
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:48,740
that you think I talk too much.

303
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:49,840
Oh, dude.

304
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:57,220
You're the one who should be in trouble.

305
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,100
Yeah, Ray.

306
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:00,440
You know, you wouldn't think it,

307
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,759
but this chocolate and salami is a great combo.

308
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,759
All right, let's all just relax.

309
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:14,139
I think we're making too big a deal of this.

310
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:14,460
Oh, no, Amy.

311
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,399
I have been putting up with this for 15 years.

312
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,259
I am not gonna let him do this to you, too.

313
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:20,440
You know, when I need to talk to Ray

314
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,720
about, like, my feelings or our children,

315
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,360
I know I have until the commercial's over.

316
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,019
That gives me 30 seconds.

317
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,840
And if there's a girl in the commercial

318
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,580
or a truck with big wheels

319
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,820
or, God forbid, a monkey, forget it.

320
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,919
Come on, it's not true.

321
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:43,879
Look, Ray, we're not asking for that much.

322
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:44,980
It's just talking and listening.

323
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:45,379
Watch.

324
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:46,519
Hello, Robert.

325
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,919
Oh, hello there, Debra.

326
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:48,519
How's it going?

327
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,500
Uh, not so good.

328
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,879
I've got a brother who lacks even rudimentary social skills.

329
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,159
I'm sorry to hear that.

330
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,220
Well, thanks for asking.

331
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,240
And by the way, those are lovely earrings.

332
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,500
See?

333
00:13:59,779 --> 00:13:59,940
Yeah.

334
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,899
Oh, that was very good.

335
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,980
Raymond, do it with me now.

336
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,259
Hello, Raymond.

337
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,759
Hello, Mother.

338
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:13,039
Oh, look, Mom, a bear in pants.

339
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:18,240
Yes, your brother is quite hairy.

340
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,500
No, Ma, he's not doing it right.

341
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,639
Yes, yes, he is, Ma.

342
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:23,279
He's also ugly.

343
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:24,740
He should really wear a welder's mask.

344
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,759
Why don't I weld your mouth to your ass

345
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:30,200
and make a doughnut out of you?

346
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,600
You don't even know how to weld.

347
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,340
I'm a damn fine welder.

348
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,320
Oh, you're stinking every day.

349
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,820
I'm gonna weld the couch for you.

350
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:36,639
All right, all right, all right.

351
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,139
Bring it on.

352
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,120
This is nothing to fight about.

353
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,200
Ray, just apologize to Amy.

354
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,639
No, it's okay.

355
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:46,279
We already talked about it.

356
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,100
And now it just seems like everybody's using it

357
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,600
as an excuse to attack him.

358
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,759
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.

359
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,600
These jackals, they pounce as soon as they smell blood.

360
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,259
They love it when I'm miserable.

361
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,059
For all I know, you guys have been sending her in

362
00:14:57,059 --> 00:14:58,620
every day on purpose just to annoy me.

363
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,500
Oh, Amy.

364
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:08,620
Oh.

365
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,039
Even I know you gotta go in there.

366
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:32,879
Hey.

367
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,139
What are you doing?

368
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,740
Just having some cookies.

369
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,620
Listen, uh, I didn't mean what I said in there, really.

370
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,500
I was just, you know, I'm mad at those guys,

371
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:49,919
and I'm sorry.

372
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,399
It's okay.

373
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:53,879
I'm fine.

374
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:58,740
Listen, you definitely have a right to be mad at me.

375
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:00,279
Oh, I do?

376
00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:01,879
I do?

377
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,840
Well, thank you very much, Ray.

378
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:05,220
You're welcome.

379
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:08,000
Let me tell you something, mister.

380
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,159
You are a frustrating person.

381
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:13,179
All this time, I've been trying to tell you, Ray.

382
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:15,740
And it's like I'm banging my head against the wall.

383
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,659
And I keep thinking, what's wrong with me?

384
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,139
Why can't I get through to him?

385
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,500
And now I realize that maybe it's not my fault.

386
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,440
Maybe it's just that you're boring.

387
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,679
You know, Debra says you're like this

388
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:33,940
because you don't want to talk.

389
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:37,440
But I think maybe it's because you've got nothing to say.

390
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:40,840
I do, too, have stuff to say.

391
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:41,360
Oh, yeah?

392
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:42,259
Go ahead.

393
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:42,740
What do you mean?

394
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:43,860
Come on.

395
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,200
Talk.

396
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:45,860
Come on, talk.

397
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,740
Right now.

398
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:50,600
And I want something more than hot dogs and football kicking.

399
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,840
Well, I just...

400
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,659
Yeah, oh, interesting conversation.

401
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:57,299
What else do you have to say, Mr. Fascinating?

402
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,620
This is a lot of pressure!

403
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,379
That's what I thought.

404
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:11,019
I'm sorry.

405
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:14,339
I was just lashing out.

406
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:15,660
Oh, I stink at this.

407
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,380
I was just trying to hurt your feelings.

408
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:18,579
Good job.

409
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:21,579
You want a tissue?

410
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,579
I'm not crying.

411
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,299
Look, Ray, I know I try too hard,

412
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,940
talking about emotions and stuff.

413
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,119
It's just that I want to be close to everyone in this family.

414
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,680
Why?

415
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,359
Because I love you guys.

416
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,440
But, I mean, for gosh sakes, I know Frank better than I know you.

417
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,079
All his sights and sounds and smells.

418
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,980
But at least I know he's comfortable with me.

419
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,160
I feel closer to him now.

420
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,500
Yeah, don't get too close.

421
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,859
We lost a canary once.

422
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:10,759
Yeah.

423
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,240
Yeah.

424
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,319
You're always so funny.

425
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:15,839
You know what?

426
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,339
It's taken some time.

427
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,660
But even Robert has started opening up to me.

428
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,380
Like, he finally told me why he sleeps with a tennis racket under his bed.

429
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,799
He still does that?

430
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,640
For the burglars.

431
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,160
That's what he told you it's for?

432
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,759
No, no, no, no, no.

433
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:32,519
That's...

434
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:35,740
That's his ghost swatter.

435
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:38,200
What?

436
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,740
Yes, yes, yeah.

437
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:41,640
Ever since we were kids, he would...

438
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,220
Listen, I don't know.

439
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,440
Listen to this.

440
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,039
One time, he was about 12, and he thought he heard something in the attic.

441
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,740
And so, of course, I'm making fun of him.

442
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:51,839
So to prove that he's not scared, he went up there with his ghost swatter.

443
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,680
So I took the...

444
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,500
I took a broom, and I went, boom, boom, boom.

445
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,099
And all of a sudden, two giant legs come crashing through the ceiling.

446
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:58,519
Boom!

447
00:18:59,060 --> 00:18:59,420
Good.

448
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,619
Just his legs?

449
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,119
Yeah.

450
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,119
Well, he fell on a beam.

451
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:02,759
Ah!

452
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:03,640
Yeah.

453
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,599
It was just two giant legs just sticking there, and they were still trying to run.

454
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:09,880
Ah!

455
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:10,460
Ah!

456
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,539
Was he injured?

457
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,579
Well, you tell me.

458
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,400
Oh, really?

459
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,339
Yeah.

460
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:20,319
Yeah.

461
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,440
Yeah.

462
00:19:21,819 --> 00:19:22,640
Hey, Amy.

463
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:24,339
Is everything okay?

464
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:24,920
Yeah.

465
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:26,619
Everything's fine, Robert.

466
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,440
Amy and I, we were just talking.

467
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:30,019
Yeah.

468
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:30,599
We were.

469
00:19:30,859 --> 00:19:31,180
Uh-huh.

470
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,299
Oh, great.

471
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,480
Well, that's very nice.

472
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:34,000
Yeah.

473
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,299
Yeah.

474
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:34,559
Yeah.

475
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:34,839
Yeah.

476
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:35,859
Yeah.

477
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,000
Yeah.

478
00:19:36,099 --> 00:19:36,559
Yeah.

479
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:36,740
Yeah.

480
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,059
Oh, please.

481
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:38,779
By all means, don't let me interrupt.

482
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:39,640
Okay.

483
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:41,480
Ah.

484
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:42,220
Oh.

485
00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:49,680
Why aren't you talking?

486
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,279
Ugh.

487
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:53,839
What were you talking about?

488
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,299
Well, nothing.

489
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,259
Shut up, really.

490
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:56,839
What were you talking about, Amy?

491
00:19:58,539 --> 00:19:59,519
Under date night.

492
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,740
Was this about me?

493
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,099
What did you tell him?

494
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,019
You told him stuff about me.

495
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:12,539
what did you say? Nothing, Robert.

496
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:14,960
He got stuff out of you. I know him.

497
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,980
Robert, we were just... Hey, come on.

498
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,220
Amy, we should get in there. Dad's probably got the fondue

499
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,559
pot on his head like Winnie the Pooh.

500
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,140
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

501
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,019
Don't lie to me. Is this

502
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:26,799
about how I eat my foods in alphabetical order?

503
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:28,319
Because I have a very good reason for that.

504
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,799
I didn't know you'd do that. I

505
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:31,500
don't!

506
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,559
Amy,

507
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:36,319
I don't want you talking to him.

508
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,319
Did you tell him about my pedicures?

509
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,759
No, Robert.

510
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:41,359
Huh?

511
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:48,660
Robert

512
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,480
paints his feet like a lady!

513
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,019
Holy crap!

514
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,259
This commercial's funny. Right, watch.

515
00:21:04,339 --> 00:21:05,119
Watch what the cat does.

516
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:06,960
Ha ha.

517
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:08,279
Ha ha.

518
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,000
He high-fives the dog. That's funny.

519
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:11,980
Those two don't usually get along.

520
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,240
Why don't you just sleep with him already?
