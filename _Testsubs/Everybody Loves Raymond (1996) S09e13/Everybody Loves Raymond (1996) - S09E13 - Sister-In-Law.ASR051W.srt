1
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:02,759
Ha!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,660
Hi, Ray!

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:06,500
Oh, hey.

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,400
Oh, uh, Deb's not here.

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,660
She's out with the kids, so I'm just, you know,

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,480
trying to make the best of it.

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,019
Yeah.

8
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:17,980
Come.

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,179
Oh. Oh, okay.

10
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:23,300
Yeah.

11
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,600
I'm just gonna watch the Nick game, you know,

12
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,800
and, uh, nothing else.

13
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:29,780
Great.

14
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:31,820
Yeah, Robert called and told me you guys were gonna

15
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,799
watch the game when he got home from work, so I thought

16
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:35,439
I'd wait for him over here. Is that okay?

17
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:37,659
Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah.

18
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,240
All right.

19
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:43,939
So, so, uh, when did Robert say

20
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:44,859
he was gonna come home?

21
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:46,600
An hour.

22
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,659
Are you excited

23
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:56,719
about fondue date night?

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,200
Yeah.

25
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,219
What, what, what, what?

26
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,659
You guys are coming over tomorrow night

27
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:08,079
for Amy's first annual fondue night.

28
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:10,299
It's gonna be just the three of our own couples.

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,420
Like a triple date.

30
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:12,299
Hey.

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,879
Yeah, a date with my parents.

32
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,359
I know you think it's corny,

33
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,939
but it'll be fun. Really.

34
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,480
Fondue date night.

35
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,180
Yeah.

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,680
Yeah, fun.

37
00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:29,480
Talk to Robert about it

38
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,099
when he gets here in, uh, 58 minutes.

39
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,099
May I?

40
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:37,180
Oh. Oh, yeah.

41
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,840
Oh, look.

42
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,980
This one looks like a heart.

43
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,060
So from now on,

44
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,540
that's where I'm buying all my sweaters.

45
00:01:58,299 --> 00:01:58,739
Hey.

46
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,000
Hey, there he is.

47
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:00,739
There he is.

48
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,879
Hi, sweetie.

49
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:03,959
Missed you.

50
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:05,099
Yeah, what's up?

51
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,480
We've been waiting an hour and 11 minutes.

52
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:10,439
Uh, Amy, Ma wanted me to remind you

53
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,180
that you'll be making the salad for the dinner tonight.

54
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,259
Oh, I forgot.

55
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,120
I better go. Darn.

56
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,120
Yeah, damn it.

57
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,439
See you later, Yogi.

58
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:22,560
And, Ray, I'll see you at fondue.

59
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:25,319
Oh.

60
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,099
Okay, yeah.

61
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:29,360
This is such a cutie pie.

62
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:29,840
Yeah.

63
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,180
Oh, it's the second half already?

64
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,960
Yeah, man, you're missing some great basketball.

65
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:34,759
Yeah.

66
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,139
Actually, I kind of missed some, too.

67
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,360
I was, uh...

68
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,819
Me and Amy, we had a nice, long...

69
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,180
chat.

70
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:46,819
All right.

71
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:48,960
That's really nice. What did you guys talk about?

72
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:50,560
Oh, gosh, pretty much everything, I think.

73
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:50,979
Yeah.

74
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,219
Uh, Amy's great, huh?

75
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:55,659
Yeah, Amy's great. She's great.

76
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:56,419
Yeah.

77
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,620
She's kind of like a little Lady Chatterley.

78
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,800
Lady Chatterley?

79
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:07,659
Yeah.

80
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,520
What do you mean?

81
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,340
Oh, you know, like, she always wants to know

82
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,539
who everybody is, and she gets real excited

83
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:16,039
about fondue date night.

84
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,580
And she told me about

85
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,639
this interesting sales girl that sold her a sweater.

86
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,280
And, you know, whatever.

87
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:22,979
It's all good stuff.

88
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:23,580
It's all good.

89
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,599
Are you saying that Amy talks too much?

90
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:34,719
No, Robert, I love Amy.

91
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,240
Wow, are you a liar.

92
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:42,800
You know, I know what it is.

93
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:45,759
I got something good, and you can't stand it.

94
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,680
Oh, you never could.

95
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,580
Remember when I made that diorama

96
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,139
in Mr. Carolyn's history class?

97
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:50,620
What?

98
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,620
Everybody said how great it was.

99
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,219
Everybody!

100
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,199
I won a prize, remember?

101
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,020
But you said it stunk.

102
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,659
You had George Washington fighting a dinosaur.

103
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,060
It was a dragon, Raymond!

104
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,280
A dragon

105
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,039
that represented years

106
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,419
of British tyranny!

107
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,199
Which just goes to show

108
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,139
how stupid you were then and now.

109
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:16,560
Robert, I didn't...

110
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,019
Everybody thinks my wife is great.

111
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:18,360
Everybody!

112
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,379
So you have to tell me

113
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:26,540
that she's a lady chatterbox

114
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,439
who won't shut up?

115
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,500
I know how it goes.

116
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,339
Jealous ass.

117
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,639
Jealous!

118
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:37,279
Yes!

119
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,560
Stop it, no!

120
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,160
Come on, don't go, Robert, stay!

121
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,139
Stay and watch the game!

122
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:46,360
You want to say something bad

123
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,319
about my wife, you can.

124
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:48,019
I don't care.

125
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,600
Ah, come on!

126
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,379
Say it, say it!

127
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,939
She's a bad cook and she's mean!

128
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,079
Hey,

129
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,160
one second, one second.

130
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,860
And you may think that, Robert,

131
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,259
but you'll be dead wrong!

132
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:06,879
Dead wrong!

133
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,480
Deborah is a caring, beautiful,

134
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,360
skinny person.

135
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,480
So how's it going?

136
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,079
Look, I saved you this chip.

137
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,860
It looks like a heart.

138
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,379
Bye, honey!

139
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,399
I've been quiet all night.

140
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:46,879
Are you okay?

141
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:47,939
Yeah, I'm fine.

142
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,060
Everything okay with you?

143
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,379
Fine and dandy.

144
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,680
Oh, did I show you this sweater I got?

145
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,439
It's nice.

146
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:00,579
The sales girl I bought it from, Bridget,

147
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,639
she was so sweet and smart.

148
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,519
She's taking some time off of school

149
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,180
to make some money,

150
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:06,519
but I really hope she finishes

151
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,740
because she was really great.

152
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:09,300
And then you bought the sweater.

153
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:09,680
Got it, got it.

154
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,920
I'm sorry.

155
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,079
Actually, you know,

156
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,319
I kind of did have a bad day.

157
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,360
Oh? What happened?

158
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,579
Oh, nothing.

159
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,600
It's just like every other day,

160
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:23,240
dealing with the scum of the earth.

161
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:25,819
Well,

162
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:28,439
at least you get tomorrow off.

163
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:30,819
And then, hey,

164
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:32,180
fondue date night.

165
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,120
That'll be fun.

166
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:36,300
Do.

167
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,240
Yeah, you know,

168
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,120
I was thinking,

169
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,139
maybe fondue date night

170
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:44,879
is not such a good idea right now.

171
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:45,939
Really?

172
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,259
Everybody else is excited about it,

173
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:48,740
even Ray.

174
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,040
Why do you even bother with him?

175
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:54,680
I know he doesn't like to open up,

176
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,980
but little by little,

177
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,740
I think I'm cracking his shell.

178
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,079
You know what?

179
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,639
There's a sweet person inside.

180
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,120
Oh, listen,

181
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:10,240
I know you and Raymond

182
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,180
have had your problems.

183
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:12,879
He said you talk too much.

184
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:16,819
What?

185
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,699
He called you Lady Blabbermouth.

186
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,379
He did?

187
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,860
Look, Amy, I'm sorry.

188
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,120
I've known Raymond

189
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,060
for a long time,

190
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,360
and do you know

191
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:36,420
he's got a lot of

192
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,420
Huh.

193
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,519
Now that I think about it,

194
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,019
while we were talking this afternoon,

195
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:46,839
he did excuse himself to go to the bathroom

196
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:47,860
like five times.

197
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,639
I thought he had a tummy problem.

198
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,360
It's not his tummy.

199
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,420
He has no soul.

200
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,980
So he just wanted me to go away?

201
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,839
That is kinda...

202
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:08,579
jerky.

203
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,500
I love you so much.

204
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,240
You know, this is good.

205
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,560
Tomorrow night, more cheese for us.

206
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:24,279
No, no, everybody's coming.

207
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,199
I'm just not gonna let Ray's

208
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,160
opinion affect me.

209
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,839
Okay, good, good.

210
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,800
Hey, you know what?

211
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,539
Don't even talk to him.

212
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:36,179
In fact, just stay quiet all night.

213
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,600
We won't even give him a chance

214
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,039
to think that way about you.

215
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:40,960
Huh?

216
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,659
Robert,

217
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:54,220
when I was just telling you

218
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,320
my sweater story,

219
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,279
and you told me to...

220
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,120
Was that because

221
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,019
you think I talk too much?

222
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,740
No, no.

223
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,139
That's because Raymond

224
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:09,659
brought it up, you know,

225
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:11,159
and I didn't want him to think that he was right.

226
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,799
Because, you know, like you said,

227
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:13,679
jerky.

228
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,740
And I love this new sweater.

229
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,019
It's a great sweater.

230
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,220
Great story about the sweater.

231
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,840
I'm stealing that story!

232
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:27,419
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

233
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,559
Amy, Amy, wait, wait.

234
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:29,480
Amy!

235
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,980
The one time I get a word in.

236
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,159
Okay, we have

237
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,679
two different kinds of cheeses,

238
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,779
and the chocolate is for all the fruit.

239
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,120
Move it, lady, I'm going in.

240
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,659
Hello!

241
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,059
Oh, hi!

242
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:59,919
Oh, Amy, everything smells great.

243
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,279
That's what I said.

244
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,259
Marie, here is the garlic toast

245
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:05,120
I made for dipping.

246
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,360
Oh, thank you.

247
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,740
Hey, Ray.

248
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,419
Listen,

249
00:10:11,659 --> 00:10:13,259
I began about before.

250
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,340
I'm sorry.

251
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,059
Oh, you don't have to apologize to me.

252
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,200
Ray, can I talk to you for a second?

253
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,340
.

254
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:25,860
.

255
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,120
.

256
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,240
.

257
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,759
What's up, sis?

258
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:34,360
Listen, Ray.

259
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,059
Robert told me about what happened yesterday,

260
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:39,080
and I just want to let you know that

261
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,340
you're right.

262
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:43,519
I should have realized you're just a guy,

263
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,580
and guys just want to relax

264
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,580
and watch TV, and I should have left you alone.

265
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,440
Amy, will you marry me?

266
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,379
You know, listen, Amy...

267
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:00,440
Oh, no, no, no, Ray.

268
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,080
I don't want things to be weird between us,

269
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,980
so I'm sorry.

270
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:04,860
Well,

271
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:07,879
me too.

272
00:11:09,859 --> 00:11:11,059
Great. Let's sit and eat.

273
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,259
Okay, all right.

274
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:14,039
I don't mind if I fondue.

275
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:14,940
.

276
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,580
All right.

277
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:19,679
I got a cheese one.

278
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,120
Wait a minute!

279
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:22,940
.

280
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,120
That's it?

281
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,039
It's fine, Robert.

282
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:29,740
Let me get this straight.

283
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,919
Raymond insults you, but you get mad at me,

284
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,559
and then you apologize to him?

285
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:37,000
What, are you taking lessons from my mom?

286
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:37,980
.

287
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,460
Who I love?

288
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:41,960
.

289
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:45,740
.

290
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,399
What's going on?

291
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:50,940
Yesterday, poor Raymond had to watch a basketball game

292
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,600
while Amy dared to sit next to him,

293
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,679
and then the minute she leaves,

294
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,019
he tells me that she had the nerve to talk to him

295
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:57,799
about things that didn't interest him,

296
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,399
called her Boxy Chatterhead.

297
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:00,120
.

298
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,980
Why would you call Amy

299
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,399
a Boxy Chatterhead?

300
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:08,080
It's Lady Chatterley.

301
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:08,980
It's from a book.

302
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,240
Oh, no, it's okay.

303
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,059
To be fair, Ray is a sports writer.

304
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,980
It's kind of like I was bothering him at work.

305
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,919
Oh, Amy.

306
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:17,799
No.

307
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,399
No, Ray doesn't work.

308
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,820
Apologize to Amy right now.

309
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:25,279
Excuse me, this is between me and Amy,

310
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:27,120
and we're fine with it.

311
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,639
Amy, kudos on the fondue.

312
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:31,360
.

313
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:31,419
.

314
00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:33,139
.

315
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:37,919
This is not between you and Amy.

316
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:39,220
What, are you kidding me?

317
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:40,980
You never listen, ever.

318
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,720
Never ever.

319
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:45,279
Oh, don't try to lay it all on Ray, Robert.

320
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,019
Last night you made it very clear

321
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:48,759
that you think I talk too much.

322
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,820
Oh, dude.

323
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,240
You're the one who should be in trouble.

324
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,100
Yeah, Ray.

325
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:00,440
You know, you wouldn't think it,

326
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,759
but this chocolate and salami is a great combo.

327
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,759
All right, let's all just relax.

328
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:14,139
I think we're making too big a deal of this.

329
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,460
Oh, no, Amy.

330
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,399
I've been hanging up with this for 15 years.

331
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,259
I am not gonna let him do this to you, too.

332
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,440
You know, when I need to talk to Ray

333
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,720
about, like, my feelings or our children,

334
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,340
I know I have until the commercial's over.

335
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,019
That gives me 30 seconds.

336
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,860
And if there's a girl in the commercial

337
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,620
or a truck with big wheels

338
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,879
or, God forbid, a monkey,

339
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:33,799
forget it.

340
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,919
Come on, it's not true.

341
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:43,879
Look, Ray, we're not asking for that much.

342
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,960
It's just talking and listening.

343
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,539
Watch. Hello, Robert.

344
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,919
Oh, hello there, Debra.

345
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:48,539
How's it going?

346
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,960
Not so good. I've got a brother who lacks

347
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,879
even rudimentary social skills.

348
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,159
I'm sorry to hear that.

349
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,220
Well, thanks for asking.

350
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,220
And by the way, those are lovely earrings.

351
00:13:59,440 --> 00:13:59,879
Yeah.

352
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,899
Oh, that was very good.

353
00:14:04,299 --> 00:14:05,980
Raymond, do it with me now.

354
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:09,259
Hello, Raymond.

355
00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:10,759
Hello, Mother.

356
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:13,059
Oh, look, Mom, a bear in pants.

357
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:18,220
Yes, your brother is quite hairy.

358
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,500
No, Ma, he's not doing it right.

359
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,500
Yes, yes, he is.

360
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:23,279
Ma, he's also ugly.

361
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,740
He should really wear a welder's mask.

362
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,759
Why don't I weld your mouth to your ass

363
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:30,200
and make a doughnut out of you?

364
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,600
You don't even know how to weld.

365
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,419
I'm a damn fine welder.

366
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,379
Oh, you're stinking every day.

367
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:35,820
I'm gonna weld the couch for you.

368
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,080
This is nothing to fight about.

369
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:43,200
Ray, just apologize to Amy.

370
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:44,639
No, it's okay.

371
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,279
We already talked about it.

372
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,100
And now it just seems like everybody's using it

373
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,600
as an excuse to attack him.

374
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.

375
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:53,600
These jackals, they pounce as soon as they smell blood.

376
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:55,279
They love it when I'm miserable.

377
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,059
For all I know, you guys have been sending her in

378
00:14:57,059 --> 00:14:58,600
every day on purpose just to annoy me.

379
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,500
Oh, Amy.

380
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:08,559
Oh.

381
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,039
Even I know you gotta go in there.

382
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:32,899
Hey.

383
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:36,139
What are you doing?

384
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,720
Just having some cookies.

385
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:46,620
Listen, uh, I didn't mean what I said in there, really.

386
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,500
I was just, you know, I'm mad at those guys.

387
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:49,899
And I'm sorry.

388
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,419
It's okay.

389
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:53,879
I'm fine.

390
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,720
Listen, you definitely have a right to be mad at me.

391
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,279
Oh, I do?

392
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:01,860
I do?

393
00:16:02,539 --> 00:16:03,779
Well, thank you very much, Ray.

394
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:05,200
You're welcome.

395
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,000
Let me tell you something, mister.

396
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,279
You are a frustrating person.

397
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,700
All this time I've been trying to talk to you

398
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,759
and it's like I'm banging my head against the wall.

399
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,659
And I keep thinking, what's wrong with me?

400
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,159
Why can't I get through to him?

401
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,500
And now I realize that maybe it's not my fault.

402
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,419
Maybe it's just that you're boring.

403
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:30,940
You know,

404
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,919
Debra says you're like this because you don't want to talk.

405
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:35,480
But I think maybe it's because

406
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,440
you've got nothing to say.

407
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:40,820
I do, too, have stuff to say.

408
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,240
Oh, yeah? Go ahead.

409
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,220
Come on, talk.

410
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,740
Come on, talk. Right now.

411
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:49,519
And I want something more than hot dogs

412
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,600
and football kicking.

413
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,840
I just...

414
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,659
Oh, interesting conversation.

415
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:57,299
What else do you have to say, Mr. Fascinating?

416
00:16:58,419 --> 00:16:59,639
This is a lot of pressure!

417
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,379
That's what I thought.

418
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:11,019
I'm sorry.

419
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,700
I'm sorry.

420
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:14,319
I was just lashing out.

421
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:15,660
Oh, I stink at this.

422
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:17,380
I was just trying to hurt your feelings.

423
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:18,559
Good job.

424
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,579
Do you want a tissue?

425
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,599
I'm not crying.

426
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,599
Look, Ray,

427
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,259
I know I try too hard

428
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,000
talking about emotions

429
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,940
and stuff.

430
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,720
But I want to be close

431
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,140
to everyone in this family.

432
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:40,660
Why?

433
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:49,339
Because I love you guys.

434
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,519
But, I mean, for gosh sakes,

435
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,440
I know Frank better than I know you.

436
00:17:54,819 --> 00:17:57,039
All his sights and sounds

437
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,079
and smells.

438
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,819
But at least I know

439
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:01,980
he's comfortable with me.

440
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,160
I feel closer to him now.

441
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,500
Yeah, don't get too close.

442
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:09,859
We lost a canary once.

443
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,299
You're always so funny.

444
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:15,819
You know what?

445
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,339
It's taken some time.

446
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,660
But even Robert has started opening up to me.

447
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,420
Like, he finally told me

448
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,380
why he sleeps with a tennis racket under his bed.

449
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,819
He still does that?

450
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,680
For the burglars.

451
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,180
That's what he told you it's for?

452
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,740
No, no, no, no, no.

453
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:32,519
That's...

454
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,660
That's his ghost swatter.

455
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:38,140
What?

456
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:39,740
Yes, yes, yeah.

457
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:40,980
Ever since we were kids,

458
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:41,640
he would...

459
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,440
Listen to this.

460
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,480
One time, he was about 12,

461
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:46,019
and he thought he heard something in the attic.

462
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,759
And so, of course, I'm making fun of him.

463
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,640
So to prove that he's not scared,

464
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,839
he went up there with his ghost swatter.

465
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,480
So I took a broom, and I went boom, boom, boom.

466
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,799
And all of a sudden,

467
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:58,099
two giant legs come crashing through the ceiling.

468
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,599
Boom! Just his legs?

469
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:02,759
Ah!

470
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,099
It was just two giant legs

471
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:07,920
just sticking there,

472
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,579
but they were still trying to run.

473
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:09,859
Ah!

474
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,539
Was he injured?

475
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:15,559
Well, you tell me.

476
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,339
Hey, Amy, is everything okay?

477
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:26,619
Yeah. Everything's fine, Robert.

478
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,440
Amy and I, we were just talking.

479
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:30,619
Yeah, we were.

480
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,180
Uh-huh.

481
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:33,500
Oh, great. Well, that's very nice.

482
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,759
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

483
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:37,779
Well, please, by all means,

484
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:38,799
don't let me interrupt.

485
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,380
Uh...

486
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:49,680
Why aren't you talking?

487
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:53,839
What were you talking about?

488
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,240
Well, nothing. Shut up, really.

489
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:56,839
What were you talking about, Amy?

490
00:19:58,519 --> 00:19:59,519
Under date night.

491
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:04,819
Oh.

492
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:08,720
Was this about me?

493
00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:10,079
What did you tell him?

494
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,599
You told him stuff about me. What did you say?

495
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:12,539
Nothing, Robert.

496
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:14,980
He got stuff out of you. I know him.

497
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,460
Robert, we were just...

498
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,059
Hey, come on, Amy, we should get in there.

499
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:19,859
Dad's probably got the fondue pot on his head

500
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:20,559
like Winnie the Pooh.

501
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,019
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't lie to me.

502
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,799
Is this about how I eat my foods in alphabetical order?

503
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,380
Because I have a very good reason for that.

504
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,420
I didn't know you'd do that.

505
00:20:30,619 --> 00:20:31,539
I don't!

506
00:20:34,139 --> 00:20:36,319
Amy, I don't want you talking to him.

507
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,319
Did you tell him about my pedicures?

508
00:20:39,859 --> 00:20:40,779
No, Robert.

509
00:20:48,139 --> 00:20:50,500
Robert paints his feet like a lady!

510
00:20:53,139 --> 00:20:54,059
Holy crap!

511
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:02,740
You're such a jerk!

512
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,500
This commercial's funny.

513
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,140
Right, watch. Watch what the cat does.

514
00:21:07,459 --> 00:21:10,539
Oh, he high-fives the dog.

515
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:11,000
That's funny.

516
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:11,960
Those two don't usually get along.

517
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,259
Why don't you just sleep with him already?

518
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:18,680
Oh, my God!

519
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:21,440
That's funny.

520
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,079
I've been sitting here all night, too, you know.

521
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,539
Oh, look, this one's got a monkey in it.

522
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,940
You're such a jerk.

523
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,119
Oh, you're such a jerk.

524
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:14,759
Oh, God!

525
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:18,819
Well, well, well.
