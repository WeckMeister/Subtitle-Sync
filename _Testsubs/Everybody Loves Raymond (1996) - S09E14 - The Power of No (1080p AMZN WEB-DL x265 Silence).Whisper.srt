1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hey, good morning.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hey.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
When did you finally come to bed?

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Because I thought you were coming right up,

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
but then I fell asleep.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Yeah, the game.

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We went into double overtime.

8
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It was amazing.

9
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Oh.

10
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Because I thought we had plans.

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Sorry.

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
God.

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Did you catch the end of that game?

14
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh, it was amazing.

15
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
See?

16
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
All right.

17
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Well, I'll let you boys talk about your exciting sports.

18
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I just hope there's not a game on tonight.

19
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Huh.

20
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What?

21
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I think she just gave me the look.

22
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What do you mean?

23
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You know.

24
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Sex.

25
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That face means sex?

26
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I thought it meant gas.

27
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Oh.

28
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Oh.

29
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh.

30
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Oh.

31
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Oh.

32
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh.

33
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh.

34
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh.

35
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Oh.

36
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Oh.

37
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Oh.

38
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Oh.

39
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Oh.

40
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Oh.

41
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Oh.

42
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Oh.

43
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Oh.

44
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Oh.

45
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Oh.

46
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Oh.

47
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Oh.

48
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Oh.

49
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh.

50
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh.

51
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh.

52
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Oh.

53
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Oh.

54
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Oh.

55
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh.

56
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh.

57
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh.

58
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Oh.

59
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Oh.

60
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Oh.

61
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh.

62
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Oh.

63
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Oh.

64
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Oh.

65
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Oh.

66
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh.

67
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh.

68
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Oh.

69
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Oh.

70
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh.

71
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh.

72
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Oh.

73
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh.

74
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Oh.

75
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Oh.

76
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Oh.

77
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Oh.

78
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:38,219
it's weird though it's weird okay last night i got the look but i i got caught up in the game

79
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:43,120
so i stayed up to watch instead of going upstairs and now instead of being mad deborah gave me the

80
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:54,260
look again huh maybe maybe i should turn her down again you know why would you do a silly thing like

81
00:01:54,260 --> 00:02:00,520
that i don't know i mean i'm always the one being shot down it felt good her wondering where i was

82
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:06,800
last night you can't turn her down i could turn her down oh come on you'll follow her around like

83
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:12,680
a dog with his tongue hanging out yeah your tongue is the leash she uses to parade you around the

84
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:21,819
park ladies and gentlemen worst in show yeah well then uh maybe that's why i should turn her down

85
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:24,240
so she doesn't take me for granted you know

86
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,600
i mean she's got to appreciate what she's got here yes you're quite a catch

87
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,280
i can hardly keep my hands off you

88
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:46,980

104
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:23,759
oh

105
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,240
so it's a medical decision you're making to stay here and helping me pick out drapes

106
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,960
ah drapes yeah well there's any material left over once you make yourself a little skirt

108
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,000
what do you mean all right

109
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,759
you thought i couldn't turn down deborah right two times my friend

110
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,100
that's good

111
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,680
last night i told her that i had a lot of work to do today

112
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,960
work

113
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,680
and then and then first thing this morning she started hinting again

114
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,000
she even brushed your teeth and everything

115
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,300
no sale

116
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:16,019
oh it's amazing it's like it's like every time i turn it down she seems to want it more

117
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:16,840
she's like a guy

118
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,160
huh but she's not getting upset

119
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,220
no no that's just she's so fiscal

120
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,240
She's been treating me better all day.

121
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,240
I came down this morning, she was making me a cheese omelet.

122
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,240
I mean, she hasn't done that since before Allie was born.

123
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,240
I mean, yeah, it had shells in it, but still.

124
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,240
You know what I've discovered?

125
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,240
The power of no.

126
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,240
Oh, the power of no. Give me a break.

127
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,240
Hey, hey, hey, who gets to hit a bucket of balls

128
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,240
in the middle of the day?

129
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,240
Yeah, well, that's just the difference

130
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,240
between me and you, Raymond.

131
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,240
You know, you like to golf by yourself

132
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,240
and have a crappy omelet, while I prefer sex.

133
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,240
No, man, you're not getting it.

134
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
Deborah can't keep her hands off me.

135
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,240
It's like with the power of no comes the power of yes.

136
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,240
Uh-huh.

137
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,240
For the first time in my marriage,

138
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,240
I finally know what it's like

139
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,240
to be the one wearing the panties.

140
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,240
You have a wrong.

141
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,240
It's a wrong and generally troubled relationship.

142
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,240
No, no, no, no, no, no, I don't.

143
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,240
It's very right.

144
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,240
But let me ask you something.

145
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,240
Why do you always feel the need

146
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,240
to be manipulative when it comes to sex?

147
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,240
Because I'm not very good at it.

148
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,240
Not very good at what?

149
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,240
Oh, you name it.

150
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,240
Hey, listen, Robert, he can't go hit balls,

151
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,240
but I was thinking that I'd still go.

152
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,240
Yeah, sure, go. Have a good time.

153
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,240
All right.

154
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,240
Hey, you know what?

155
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,240
They got a great hot dog guy there.

156
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,240
You want me to bring you back one?

157
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,240
No, I shouldn't.

158
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,240
I got to watch my figure.

159
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,240
Hey, you let me be the one to watch your figure.

160
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,240
Let me watch your figure?

161
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,240
That's not funny.

162
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,240
That's right, it's not, and yet it is.

163
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
Because she is weak.

164
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,240
Weak for my physique.

165
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,240
Oh.

166
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,240
Oh, don't those look nice?

167
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,240
Yeah.

168
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
I don't know why Robert had such a hard time

169
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,240
putting them up yesterday.

170
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,240
Well, he can't handle normal-sized tools

171
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,240
with those giant fingers.

172
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,240
Here, push that curtain over a little

173
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,240
so we don't see his blood.

174
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
So what do you think, Deb?

175
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,240
Yeah, they look great.

176
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,240
Deborah, dear, you're being so quiet.

177
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,240
That's not like you.

178
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,240
No, I'm fine.

179
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,240
It's just...

180
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,240
Do I look different to you?

181
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
What do you mean?

182
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,240
I don't know.

183
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,240
I'm just feeling...

184
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,240
Have I drooped?

185
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,240
Drooped?

186
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,240
You know, you try to work out

187
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,240
and take care of yourself,

188
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
and yet there still comes a day

189
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,240
when everything just...

190
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,240
I wouldn't know about that.

191
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,240
Oh, stop it, Deb.

192
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,240
You look great.

193
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,240
You know how my friends and I keep fit?

194
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,240
Water aerobics at the Y.

195
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,240
Say, why don't you come with us tomorrow?

196
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
Oh, well, I'll have to check and see if I'm free.

197
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,240
Oh, well, have a ball.

198
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Let me go look for an extra pair of nose clips

199
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,240
and a swim cap.

200
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
Deb, are you really upset about this?

201
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,240
No.

202
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,240
Ray keeps turning me down.

203
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,240
What do you mean?

204
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,240
Sex?

205
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,240
Yeah.

206
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,240
That doesn't sound like him.

207
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,240
He usually follows you around with his tongue hanging out.

208
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
I know.

209
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,240
I'm sure it's not you.

210
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,240
Hey, maybe he's sick.

211
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
Nah.

212
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,240
I wish he was.

213
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,240
Oh, man.

214
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,240
Who am I kidding?

215
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
I should just go with Marie to the Y,

216
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,240
or a swim cap,

217
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,240
and float around with the old ladies.

218
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,240
Hey, you know,

219
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,240
it's funny you bringing this up,

220
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,240
because last night when Robert and I went to bed,

221
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,240
he was acting kind of distant, too.

222
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,240
But then I just kissed his neck,

223
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,240
and he said, Ray's crazy.

224
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,240
He did?

225
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,240
Yeah.

226
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,240
And then he said something about how I could have all the power.

227
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,240
It was weird.

228
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,240
Yeah, he usually doesn't like to mention Ray in the bedroom.

229
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,240
He says it inhibits him.

230
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,240
The power?

231
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,240
I mean, why would he s...

232
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,240
Uh.

233
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,240
What?

234
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,240
Oh, my God.

235
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,240
Oh, my God.

236
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,240
He has been turning me down on purpose.

237
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
Oh, no.

238
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,240
Why would he do that?

239
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,240
For the power.

240
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,240
He thinks it gives him more power.

241
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,240
Oh, my God.

242
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,240
I know.

243
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,240
I know.

244
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,240
I know.

245
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,240
I know.

246
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,240
I know.

247
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,240
I know.

248
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,240
I know.

249
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,240
I know.

250
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,240
I know.

251
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,240
I know.

252
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,240
I know.

253
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,240
I know.

254
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
I know.

255
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,240
I know.

256
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,240
I know.

257
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,240
I know.

258
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,240
I know.

259
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
The power is in the upper hand or something.

260
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,240
Well, that's gross.

261
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,240
Hey, look on the bright side.

262
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,240
This means you're still hot.

263
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,240
Of course, I am.

264
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,240
You know, the worst part about this is that it worked.

265
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,240
I've been trying to make myself look better for him.

266
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,820
Do you know I did 138 sit ups this morning all for some guy whose stomach looks like

267
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,860
a deflated clown balloon?

268
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,879
Boy, boy.

269
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,279
You're gonna kill him, aren't you?

270
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,279
No.

271
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,279
No.

272
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:18,279
I want him alive.

273
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:29,120
Hey, Jimmy Jack.

274
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,419
Hey. How was work?

275
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:33,339
Good. Where are the kids?

276
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:35,139
I sent them over to the Parker's.

277
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:36,139
Why?

278
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:38,139
I wanted them out of the house.

279
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:41,139
Oh, yeah?

280
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:43,100
I didn't think it would be appropriate for the children

281
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,139
to see what I was going to do to you.

282
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,139
Oh, gosh. Really, Deb?

283
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:51,139
Right now, I don't know.

284
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:54,139
I mean, I got a lot to do.

285
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:56,139
Really, Deb, I think...

286
00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:59,159
You're just so powerful.

287
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:04,159
Yeah, yeah, well...

288
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,159
I just can't resist a man with so much power.

289
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:12,159
Okay, look, I'm really starting to feel a little uncomfortable.

290
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:19,139
What's with you?

291
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:22,139
Robert told Amy why you've been turning me down.

292
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:24,139
I hate that guy.

293
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:28,159
So you were just toying with me?

294
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:30,159
Getting me to beg for sex?

295
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:32,159
That makes you feel good?

296
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:34,159
No. No, I don't know. I just...

297
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:36,159
I guess I wanted to see what it was like

298
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:38,159
to be the one being pursued for once.

299
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:40,159
But you made me feel terrible about myself.

300
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,159
You just kept rejecting me.

301
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:44,159
How could you do that to somebody?

302
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,139
What?

303
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:50,139
You had me convinced I was a fat, ugly old lady.

304
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:53,139
Well, now you know how I feel.

305
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:56,139
You feel bad because I turned you down, what, three times?

306
00:12:56,139 --> 00:12:58,159
Try being rejected 40 or 50 times every year

307
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:00,159
for the last ten years.

308
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:01,159
How do you think that feels?

309
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,159
You're looking at the president

310
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:05,159
of the fat, ugly old ladies' club.

311
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,159
Welcome. Have a doughnut.

312
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:10,159
There is no way I turn you down that much.

313
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:12,159
And I say yes a lot.

314
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,159
Exactly. You say yes, and you say no.

315
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:16,139
You're the bouncer.

316
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:18,139
You're the bouncer in front of the disco

317
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:20,139
who decides who gets in and who doesn't.

318
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:22,139
And for once, it was you standing outside.

319
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:24,139
Yeah, and you couldn't take it.

320
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:26,139
Yeah, it's cold out there, isn't it?

321
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,159
Standing in the rain with your bad shirt

322
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:30,159
and your acne pimples.

323
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:32,159
There is no way you can compare me turning you down

324
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:34,159
with what you did to me.

325
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:36,159
Listen, Ray, if I turn you down,

326
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:38,159
it is because I am exhausted from taking care

327
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:40,159
of three kids all day and thinking

328
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:42,159
of everything that I have to do the next day.

329
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:44,159
Still using the kids, huh?

330
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:46,139
Oh, my God.

331
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:48,139
I don't think I ever wanted to have sex with you.

332
00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:50,139
Yeah, well, you don't have to worry,

333
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:52,139
because I'm not sure the next time

334
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,139
you're getting sex from me.

335
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:56,139
Oh, you're threatening me with no sex, please.

336
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:58,139
Yeah, you will be saying please.

337
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:00,139
Pretty please with sugar on top.

338
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,139
I'm serious.

339
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:04,139
I don't know when I'll be in the mood again.

340
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:06,139
You are always in the mood.

341
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:08,139
You wouldn't last a night.

342
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,139
I just did three nights, Lady Pantaloons.

343
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:14,139
Okay, so we'll see who can't last.

344
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:16,139
Oh, my.

345
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:18,139
How will I ever resist my baser instincts?

346
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:20,139
Yeah, I like that.

347
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:22,139
I like the Southern thing.

348
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:24,139
That'll be good when you come back saying

349
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:26,139
pretty please with sugar on top.

350
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:42,139
Okay, well, good enough.

351
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:44,139
Ugh.

352
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:46,139
Okay.

353
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:10,139
Oh, my God.

354
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,139
Are those silk?

355
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:14,139
I believe they're satin.

356
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:16,139
You want a feel?

357
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:22,139
It's quite all right.

358
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:26,139
What's with all your lacy apparel?

359
00:15:26,139 --> 00:15:28,139
Nothing.

360
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:30,139
It's just pajamas.

361
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:46,139
Good night.

362
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:48,139
Good night.

363
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:50,139
Good night.

364
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:52,139
Good night.

365
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:54,139
Yeah.

366
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:56,139
Yeah, yeah.

367
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:58,139
I'm a little tired, too.

368
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:08,139
Did you put oil on?

369
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:10,139
Did you put oil on?

370
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,139
No.

371
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:14,139
It's just my natural juices.

372
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,139
See?

373
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:40,139
What are you doing?

374
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:42,139
Me?

375
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:44,139
What'd you have my mom put on?

376
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:46,139
Your makeup on?

377
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,139
No sex for you.

378
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:52,139
No sex for you.

388
00:17:44,140 --> 00:18:06,140
All right, you win!

389
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,140
What?

390
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,140
I give up!

391
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,140
I am officially asking you to please

392
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,140
have some sex with me.

393
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,140
What are you talking about?

394
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,140
Our thing!

395
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,140
Our not-having-sex thing!

396
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,140
Are we still doing that?

397
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,140
Of course we're still doing it.

398
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,140
It's been 26 days of doing it.

399
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,140
Not doing it!

400
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,140
Sorry, I totally forgot.

401
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,140
Yeah, right!

402
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,140
I can't believe it, but really,

403
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,140
I totally forgot.

404
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,140
You expect me to believe that you didn't realize

405
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,140
that we went 26 days without having sex?

406
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,140
I've been really busy.

407
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,140
The PTA fundraiser is coming up.

408
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,140
I've just had a lot on my mind.

409
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,140
26 days?

410
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,140
You weren't even trying.

411
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,140
Guess I was never really close to having the power,

412
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,140
was I?

413
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,140
Sorry.

414
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,140
All this time,

415
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,140
I thought you were doing all those

416
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,140
little things to torture me.

417
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,140
What things?

418
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,140
Forget it.

419
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,140
No, come on.

420
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,140
No, like biting your lower lip

421
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,140
when you use the remote to change the channel.

422
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,140
I do that?

423
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,140
Or how about when you keep

424
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,140
one of your legs outside of the covers

425
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,140
and the pajama rides up it?

426
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,140
That's just because I'm hot.

427
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,140
Yes, you are!

428
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,140
Even when you sleep,

429
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,140
every so often you kind of sigh a little.

430
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,140
You haven't slept much lately, have you?

431
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,140
No.

432
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,140
Even now,

433
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,140
look at you,

434
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,140
with your hair like that,

435
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,140
sitting there,

436
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,140
with your...

437
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,140
robe.

438
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,140
What a mess!

439
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,140
Yeah, well,

440
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,140
I guess even when you're not trying,

441
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,140
it still works.

442
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,140
What?

443
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,140
What are you doing?

444
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,140
You just got a little of your power back.

445
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,140
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

446
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,140
Are you toying with me?

447
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,140
Because if you are,

448
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,140
I'm just gonna start to cry.

449
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,140
I've been waiting for this for a long time, too, Ray.

450
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,140
And by the way,

451
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,140
it's been 27 days, not 26.

452
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,140
All right.

453
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,140
You're doing...

454
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,140
Remember.

455
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,140
Morning!

456
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,140
Morning, kids.

457
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,140
What are you doing here?

458
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,140
Well, you live here.

459
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,140
No, no, no, no.

460
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,140
No!

461
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,140
Hey, you guys can make breakfast yourself, right?

462
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,140
Because Daddy has to talk to Mommy upstairs about something.

463
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,140
Eh?

464
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,140
Eh?

465
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,140
Eh?

466
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,140
Hmm.

467
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,140
All right.

468
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,140
So, ladies.

469
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,140
Ah!
