Because I thought you were coming right up,

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Because I thought you were coming right up,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000

17
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:54,260
look again huh maybe maybe i should turn

maybe i should turn her down again you

19
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:54,260
why would you do a silly thing like

20
00:01:54,260 --> 00:02:00,520

00:01:54,260 --> 00:02:00,520
i mean i'm always the one being shot

22
00:01:54,260 --> 00:02:00,520
it felt good her wondering where i was

23
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:06,800
last night you can't turn her down i

24
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:06,800
night you can't turn her down i could

25
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:06,800
down oh come on you'll follow her around

26
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:12,680
a dog with his tongue hanging out yeah

27
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:12,680
yeah your tongue is the leash she uses

28
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:12,680
the leash she uses to parade you around

29
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:21,819
park ladies and gentlemen worst in show yeah

30
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:21,819
worst in show yeah well then uh maybe

31
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:21,819
uh maybe that's why i should turn her

32
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:24,240
so she doesn't take me for granted you

33
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,600

Hey, listen, Robert, he can't go hit balls,

87
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,240
but I was thinking that I'd still go.

88
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,240

That's right, it's not, and yet it is.

95
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,240
That's right, it's not, and yet it is.

96
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
I don't know why Robert had such a

97
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
I don't know why Robert had such a

98
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
I don't know why Robert had such a

99
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
I don't know why Robert had such a

100
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,240
You know how my friends and I keep

101
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,240
You know how my friends and I keep

Say, why don't you come with us tomorrow?

103
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
I'll have to check and see if I'm

00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
Oh, well, I'll have to check and see

105
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Let me go look for an extra pair

106
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
Oh, well, I'll have to check and see

107
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,240
He usually follows you around with his tongue

108
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,240
He usually follows you around with his tongue

109
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
I should just go with Marie to the

110
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
I should just go with Marie to the

111
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
I should just go with Marie to the

112
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
I should just go with Marie to the

113
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,240
because last night when Robert and I went

114
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,240
And then he said something about how I

115
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,240
And then he said something about how I

116
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,240
And then he said something about how I

117
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,240
about how I could have all the power.

118
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,240
Yeah, he usually doesn't like to mention Ray

119
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,240
And then he said something about how I

120
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,240
Yeah, he usually doesn't like to mention Ray

121
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
The power is in the upper hand or

122
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
power is in the upper hand or something.

123
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
The power is in the upper hand or

124
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,240
You know, the worst part about this is

125
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,820
Do you know I did 138 sit ups

126
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,240
You know, the worst part about this is

127
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,240
worst part about this is that it worked.

128
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,240
I've been trying to make myself look better

129
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,820
Do you know I did 138 sit ups

130
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,820
this morning all for some guy whose stomach

131
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,820
all for some guy whose stomach looks like

132
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:43,100
I didn't think it would be appropriate for

133
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:43,100
I didn't think it would be appropriate for

134
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:43,100
I didn't think it would be appropriate for

135
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,139
to see what I was going to do

136
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:43,100
I didn't think it would be appropriate for

137
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:54,139
I mean, I got a lot to do.

138
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:54,139
I mean, I got a lot to do.

139
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,159
I just can't resist a man with so

140
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,159
I just can't resist a man with so

141
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:12,159
Okay, look, I'm really starting to feel a

142
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:22,139
Robert told Amy why you've been turning me

143
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:38,159
to be the one being pursued for once.

144
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:40,159
But you made me feel terrible about myself.

145
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:36,159
I guess I wanted to see what it

146
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:36,159
guess I wanted to see what it was

147
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:38,159
to be the one being pursued for once.

148
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:40,159
But you made me feel terrible about myself.

149
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:40,159
But you made me feel terrible about myself.

150
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:36,159
I guess I wanted to see what it

151
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:50,139
You had me convinced I was a fat,

152
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:50,139
You had me convinced I was a fat,

153
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:56,139
feel bad because I turned you down, what,

154
00:12:56,139 --> 00:12:58,159
Try being rejected 40 or 50 times every

155
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:10,159
is no way I turn you down that

156
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:10,159
There is no way I turn you down

157
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,159
Exactly. You say yes, and you say no.

158
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,159
Exactly. You say yes, and you say no.

159
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:18,139
You're the bouncer in front of the disco

160
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:20,139
who decides who gets in and who doesn't.

161
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:22,139
And for once, it was you standing outside.

162
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,159
Exactly. You say yes, and you say no.

163
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,159
Standing in the rain with your bad shirt

164
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,159
Standing in the rain with your bad shirt

165
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:32,159
There is no way you can compare me

166
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:22,139
And for once, it was you standing outside.

167
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:32,159
There is no way you can compare me

168
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:38,159
it is because I am exhausted from taking

169
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:38,159
is because I am exhausted from taking care

170
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:42,159
of everything that I have to do the

171
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:42,159
of everything that I have to do the

172
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:48,139
I ever wanted to have sex with you.

173
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:48,139
I don't think I ever wanted to have

174
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:42,159
everything that I have to do the next

175
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:56,139
Oh, you're threatening me with no sex, please.

176
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:56,139
Oh, you're threatening me with no sex, please.

177
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:04,139
I don't know when I'll be in the

178
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:56,139
