00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hey, good morning.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hey.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
When did you finally come to bed?

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Because I thought you were coming right up,

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
but then I fell asleep.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Yeah, the game.

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We went into double overtime.

8
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It was amazing.

9
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Oh.

10
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Because I thought we had plans.

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Sorry.

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
God.

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Did you catch the end of that game?

14
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh, it was amazing.

15
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
See?

16
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
All right.

17
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Well, I'll let you boys talk about your exciting sports.

18
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I just hope there's not a game on tonight.

19
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Huh.

20
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What?

21
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I think she just gave me the look.

22
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What do you mean?

23
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You know.

24
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Sex.

25
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That face means sex?

26
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I thought it meant gas.

27
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Oh.

28
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Oh.

29
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh.

30
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Oh.

31
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Oh.

32
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh.

33
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh.

34
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh.

35
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Oh.

36
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Oh.

37
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Oh.

38
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Oh.

39
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Oh.

40
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Oh.

41
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Oh.

42
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Oh.

43
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Oh.

44
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Oh.

45
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Oh.

46
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Oh.

47
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Oh.

48
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Oh.

49
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh.

50
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh.

51
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh.

52
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,119
Oh.

53
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:04,120
Oh.

54
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,120
Yeah.

55
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,120
I think Amy's in the mood now.

56
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,120
Yeah.

57
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,120
She does it better.

58
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,120
OK?

59
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,120
Yeah.

60
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,120
I know when Amy's in the mood.

61
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,120
Cause she always gives me this sexy little sideways smile.

62
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,120
Yeah.

63
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,120
Yeah.

64
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,120
Yeah.

65
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,120
Yeah.

66
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,219
I think Amy's saying hurry up and get it over with.

67
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:18,219
Mm-hmm.

68
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:21,760
Your mother's got a look, too.

69
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:27,719
Which is why after sunset, I avoid all eye contact.

70
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:28,819
Oh.

71
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:38,219
it's weird though it's weird okay last night i got the look but i i got caught up in the game

72
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:43,120
so i stayed up to watch instead of going upstairs and now instead of being mad deborah gave me the

77
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:21,479
the park ladies and gentlemen worst in show yeah well then uh maybe that's why i should turn her

78

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,600

All right. You thought I couldn't turn down Debra, right?

103
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,460
Two times, my friend!

104
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,080
Yeah, last night I told her that I had a lot of work to do today.

105
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:02,439
Ha-ha-ha, work!

106
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,800
And then, and then, first thing this morning,

107
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,980
she started hinting again.

108
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,240
She even brushed her teeth and everything.

109
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,480
But no sale!

110
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,379
Oh, it's amazing. It's like, it's like,

111
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,600
every time I turn her down, she seems to want it more.

112
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,840
She's like a guy.

113
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,860
Huh. And she's not getting upset?

114
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,480
No, no, no, that's just it.

115
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,379
She's been treating me better all day.

116
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,680
I came down this morning, she was making me a cheese omelet.

117
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,240
I mean, she hasn't done that since before Allie was born.

118
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,540
I mean, yeah, it had shells in it, but still.

119
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,300
You know what I've discovered?

120
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,620
The power of no.

121
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:43,900
Oh, the power of no. Give me a break.

122
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,160
Hey, hey, hey, who gets to hit a bucket of balls

123
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,220
in the middle of the day?

124
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,560
Yeah, well, that's just the difference

125
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,600
between me and you, Raymond.

126
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,800
You know, you like to golf,

127
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,439
play yourself, and have a crappy omelet

128
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,480
while I prefer sex.

129
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,819
No, man, you're not getting it.

130
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,600
Deborah can't keep her hands off me.

131
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,340
It's like with the power of no

132
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,540
comes the power of yes.

133
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,259
Uh-huh.

134
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,060
For the first time in my marriage,

135
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,080
I finally know what it's like

136
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,500
to be the one wearing the panties.

137
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:24,079
You have a wrong and generally troubled relationship.

138
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:25,639
No, no, no, no, no, no, I don't.

139
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:26,639
It's very right.

140
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,620
But let me ask you something.

141
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,860
Why do you always feel the need

142
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,120
to be manipulative when it comes to sex?

143
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,639
Because I'm not very good at it.

144
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,980
Not very good at what?

145
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:39,060
Oh, you name it.

146
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,439
Hey, listen, Robert, he can't go hit balls,

147
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,759
but I was thinking that I'd still go.

148
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:43,959
Yeah, sure, go.

149
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,480
Have a good time.

150
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:45,100
All right.

151
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,300
Hey, you know what?

152
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,680
They got a great hot dog guy there.

153
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:55,620
You want me to bring you back one?

154
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,259
No, I shouldn't.

155
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,160
I got to watch my figure.

156
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,000
Hey, you let me be the one to watch your figure.

157
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,240
Let me watch your figure?

158
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:08,920
That's not funny.

159
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,379
That's right, it's not,

160
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:12,180
and yet it is!

161
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,100
Because she is weak.

162
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,160
Weak for my physique.

putting them up yesterday.

182
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,420

00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:10,560
Yeah, they look great.

190
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,319
Deborah, dear,

191
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,159
you're being so quiet.

192
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:13,259
You're being so quiet.

193
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:23,759
quiet that's not like you I'm fine it's just do I look different to you what do

194
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:35,220
you mean I don't know I'm just feeling have I drooped you try to work out and

195
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:41,759
take care of yourself and there still comes a day when everything just I

196
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:54,960
wouldn't know about that you know how my friends and I keep fit water aerobics

197
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:00,600
at the Y say why don't you come with us tomorrow I'll have to check and see if

198
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:09,559
I'm free let me go look for an extra pair of nose clips and a swim cap

199
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:29,460
really upset about this keeps turning me down what do you mean sex that doesn't

200
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:37,480
sound like him he usually follows you around with his tongue hanging I'm sure

201
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,200
it's not you hey maybe he's sick

202
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:48,000
I wish he was oh man who am I kidding I should just go with Marie to the Y put on

203
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,500
a flowery swim cap and float around with the old ladies hey you know it's funny you

204
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:01,139
bringing this up because last night when Robert and I went to bed he was acting kind of distant

205
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:11,100
too but then I just kissed his neck and he said Ray's crazy he did yeah and then he said something

206
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:17,819
that was funny about the fact that you're a man but you're a woman and you're married

207
00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:21,360
to a woman who you can't have a large body and you could have all the power

208
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,179
just weird yeah he usually doesn't like to mention Ray in the bedroom

209
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:33,460
says it inhibits him power I mean why

210
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:41,700
would he say oh my god oh my god he has been turning me down on purpose oh no

211
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:41,740
why would he do that?

212
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:42,659
For the power!

213
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,639
He thinks it gives him the upper hand or something.

214
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,200
Well, that's gross.

215
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:53,100
Hey, but look on the bright side.

216
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:54,000
This means you're still hot.

217
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:55,279
Of course I am.

218
00:10:57,019 --> 00:10:58,720
You know what the worst part about this is?

219
00:10:58,759 --> 00:10:59,539
That it worked.

220
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,919
I've been trying to make myself look better for him.

221
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,960
Do you know I did 138 sit-ups this morning

222
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,460
all for some guy whose stomach

223
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,419
looks like a deflated clown balloon.

224
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:12,959
Oh, boy, you're going to kill him, aren't you?

225
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,139
No.

226
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:17,740
No, I want him alive.

227
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:28,439
Hey, Jimmy Jack.

228
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:29,199
Hey.

229
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:30,620
How was work?

230
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,439
Good.

231
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:32,339
Where are the kids?

232
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,399
I sent them over to the Parker's.

233
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,139
Why?

234
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:36,839
I wanted them out of the house.

235
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,339
Oh, yeah?

236
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:42,099
I didn't think it would be appropriate

237
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:44,299
for the children to see what I was going to do to you.

238
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:46,740
Oh, gosh.

239
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:47,479
Really, Deb?

240
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,439
Right now, I don't know.

241
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:53,339
I mean, I got a lot to do.

242
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:56,259
Really, Deb, I think...

243
00:11:56,259 --> 00:11:58,860
You're just so powerful.

244
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:03,899
Yeah, yeah, well...

245
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:07,059
I just can't resist a man with so much power.

246
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:11,459
Okay, look, I'm really starting to feel a little uncomfortable.

247
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:11,839
Ah!

248
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:18,620
What's with you?

249
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:21,019
Robert told Amy why you've been turning me down.

250
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I hate that guy.

251
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:27,879
So you were just toying with me?

252
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:30,019
Getting me to beg for sex?

253
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:31,439
That makes you feel good?

254
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:31,860
No.

255
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,019
No, I don't know.

256
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:33,459
I just...

257
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,299
I guess I wanted to see what it was like

258
00:12:35,299 --> 00:12:37,399
to be the one being pursued for once.

259
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:40,039
But you made me feel terrible about myself.

260
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:41,419
You just kept rejecting me.

261
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:43,120
How could you do that to somebody?

262
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,379
What?

263
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:50,340
You had me convinced I was a fat, ugly old lady.

264
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,959
Well, now you know how I feel.

265
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:56,059
You feel bad because I turned you down, what, three times?

266
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,679
Try being rejected 40 or 50 times every year

267
00:12:58,679 --> 00:12:59,879
for the last 10 years.

268
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,299
How do you think that feels?

269
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,439
You're looking at the president

270
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:03,939
of the fat, ugly old ladies club.

271
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:05,819
Welcome.

272
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:06,579
Have a donut.

273
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:10,840
There is no way I turn you down that much.

274
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,459
And I say yes a lot.

275
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:12,959
Exactly.

276
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,579
You say yes and you say no.

277
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,899
You're the bouncer in front of the disco

278
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:18,620
who decides who gets in and who doesn't.

279
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,799
And for once it was you standing outside.

280
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:22,240
Yeah, and you couldn't take it.

281
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,759
Yeah, it's cold out there, isn't it?

282
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:26,199
Standing in the rain with your bad shirt

283
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:27,240
and your acne pimples.

284
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:30,579
There is no way you can compare me turning you down

285
00:13:30,579 --> 00:13:31,600
with what you did to me.

286
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:32,840
Listen, Ray, if I turn you down,

287
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:34,240
it is because I am exhausted

288
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,980
from taking care of three kids all day

289
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,279
and thinking of everything that I have to do

290
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:37,899
the next day.

291
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,740
Still using the kids, huh?

292
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:45,360
Oh, my God.

293
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:47,679
I can't believe I ever wanted to have sex with you.

294
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,100
Yeah, well, you don't have to worry

295
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,439
because I'm not sure the next time

296
00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:51,620
you're getting sex from me.

297
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:55,559
Oh, you're threatening me with no sex, please.

298
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,100
Yeah, you will be saying please.

299
00:13:57,179 --> 00:13:58,419
Pretty please with sugar on top.

300
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,139
I'm serious.

301
00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:02,559
I don't know when I'll be in the mood again.

302
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:06,620
You are always in the mood.

303
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,259
You wouldn't last.

304
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,120
You wouldn't last a night.

305
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,279
I just did three nights, Lady Pantaloons.

306
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,720
Okay, so we'll see who can't last.

307
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:15,919
Oh, my.

308
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,259
How will I ever resist my baser instincts?

309
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,139
Yeah.

310
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:20,439
I like that.

311
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:21,959
I like the Southern thing.

312
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,899
That'll be good when you come back saying

313
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:25,799
pretty please with sugar on top.

314
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,519
Finally.

315
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,799
Okay, well, good kno...

316
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,679
Ugh.

317
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:54,279
Oh!

318
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,839
Ugh.

319
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:57,459
Ugh.

320
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,579
Ugh.

321
00:14:58,659 --> 00:15:00,439
Ugh.

322
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:01,500
Ugh.

323
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:03,279
Ugh.

324
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:06,539
Ugh.

325
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:06,959
Ugh.

326
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:07,240
Ugh.

336

I am officially asking you to please have some sex with me.

337
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,059
What are you talking about?

338
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:27,160
Our thing! Our not-having-sex thing!

339
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:29,819
Are we still doing that?

340
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,779
Of course we're still doing it.

341
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:37,259
It's been 26 days of doing it.

342
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:38,759
Not doing it!

343
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,420
Sorry, I totally forgot.

344
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,299
Yeah, right.

345
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:48,680
I mean, I can't believe it, but really, I totally forgot.

346
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:49,500
Please!

347
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,160
You expect me to believe that you didn't realize

348
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,660
that we went 26 days without having sex?

349
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:01,799
I've been really busy, you know.

350
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:04,139
The PTA fundraiser is coming up,
