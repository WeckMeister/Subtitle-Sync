1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ha!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hi, Ray!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Oh, hey.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Oh, uh, Deb's not here.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
She's out with the kids, so I'm just, you know,

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
trying to make the best of it.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yeah.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Come.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Oh. Oh, okay.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm just gonna watch the Nick game, you know,

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and, uh, nothing else.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Great.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah, Robert called and told me you guys were gonna watch the game

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
when he got home from work,

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
so I thought I'd wait for him over here.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Is that okay?

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
All right.

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So, so, uh,

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
when did Robert say he was gonna come home?

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
About an hour.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Are you excited about what's next?

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yeah.

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
A fondue date night?

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What, what, what, what?

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You guys are coming over tomorrow night

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
for Amy's first annual fondue night.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's gonna be just the three of our own couples.

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Like a triple date.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Hey.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yeah, a date with my parents.

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I know you think it's corny, but it'll be fun.

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Really.

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Fondue date night.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah.

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You don't want to, uh,

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
talk to Robert about it

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
when he gets here in, uh, 58 minutes.

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
May I?

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Oh. Oh, yeah.

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Oh, look,

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
this one looks like a heart.

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So from now on,

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
that's where I'm buying all my sweaters.

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
There he is.

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Hey, there he is. There he is.

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Hi, sweetie.

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Missed you.

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah, what's up? We've been waiting an hour and 11 minutes.

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Uh, Amy,

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Ma wanted me to remind you that you'll be making the salad

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
for the dinner tonight.

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Oh, I forgot. I better go. Darn.

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yeah, damn it.

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
See you later, Yogi.

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And Ray, I'll see you

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
at fondue.

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Okay, yeah.

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is such a cutie pie.

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah.

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Oh, it's the second half already?

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah, man. You're missing some great basketball.

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah.

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Actually, I kind of missed some, too.

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It was, uh, me and Amy,

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
we had a nice, long

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
chat.

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
All right. That's really nice.

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What did you guys talk about?

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh, gosh, pretty much everything, I think.

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Uh, Amy's great, huh?

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yeah, Amy's great. She's great.

74
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah.

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
She's kind of like a little

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Lady Chatterley.

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Lady Chatterley?

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yeah. What do you mean?

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh, you know, like, she always

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
wants to know where everybody is,

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
and she gets real excited about fondue

82
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
date night.

83
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And she told me about this interesting sales girl

84
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and told her a sweater and, you know,

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
whatever. It's all good stuff.

86
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's all good.

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Are you saying that Amy talks too much?

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No, Robert, I love Amy.

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Wow, are you a liar.

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You know, I know what it is.

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I got something good, and you can't stand it.

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh, you never could. Remember when I made

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
that diorama in Mr. Carolyn's history class?

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What?

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Everybody said how great it was.

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Everybody!

97
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I won a prize, remember?

98
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But you said it stunk.

99
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You had George Washington fighting a dinosaur.

100
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It was a dragon, Raymond!

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
A dragon that represented

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
years of British tyranny!

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Which just goes to show how stupid

104
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
you were then and now.

105
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Uh, Robert, I didn't...

106
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Everybody!

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So you have to tell me that she's a lady

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
chatterbox who won't shut up?

109
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I know how it goes.

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Jealous

111
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
ass.

112
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Jealous!

113
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes!

114
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Stop it. No.

115
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
No, come on. Don't go, Robert.

116
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Stay. Stay and watch the game.

117
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Come on. You want to say something

118
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
bad about my wife, you can. I don't care.

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Oh, come on.

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Say it.

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Say it.

122
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
She's a bad cook and she's mean.

123
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Hey.

124
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
All right.

125
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
All right. One second. One second.

126
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And you may think that, Robert,

127
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
but you'll be dead wrong.

128
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Dead wrong!

129
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Deborah is a caring,

130
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
beautiful, skinny person.

131
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So how's it going?

132
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Oh.

133
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Look, I saved you this chip.

134
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It looks like a heart.

135
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Hi, honey.

136
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Hi.

137
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You've been quiet all night. Are you okay?

138
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yeah, I'm fine. Everything okay with you?

139
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Fine and dandy.

140
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Oh, did I show you this sweater I got?

141
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's nice.

142
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The sales girl I bought it from, Bridget,

143
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
she was so sweet and smart.

144
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
She's taking some time off of school to make some money,

145
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
but I really hope she finishes because she was really great.

146
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And then you bought the sweater. Got it.

147
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm sorry.

148
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Actually, you know, I kind of did have a bad day.

149
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Oh?

150
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What happened?

151
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Oh, nothing. It's just like every other day,

152
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
dealing with the scum of the earth.

153
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Well, at least you get tomorrow off.

154
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And then, hey, fondue date night.

155
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That'll be fun.

156
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Do.

157
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yeah, you know,

158
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I was thinking maybe fondue date night

159
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
would be a good idea right now.

160
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Really?

161
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Everybody else is excited about it.

162
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Even Ray.

163
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What do you even bother with him?

164
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I know he doesn't like to open up,

165
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
but little by little,

166
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I think I'm cracking his shell.

167
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You know what?

168
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
There's a sweet person inside.

169
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Oh, listen.

170
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I know you and Raymond have had your problems.

171
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You can't talk too much.

172
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What?

173
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
He called you Lady Blabbermouth.

174
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
He did?

175
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Look, Amy, I'm sorry.

176
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I've known Raymond for a long time, and

177
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
do you know what a

178
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
gel-ass is?

179
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Huh.

180
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Now that I think about it,

181
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
while we were talking this afternoon,

182
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
he did excuse himself to go to the bathroom

183
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
like five times.

184
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I thought he had a tummy problem.

185
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's not his tummy.

186
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
He has no soul.

187
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So he just wanted me to go away?

188
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That is kind of...

189
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
jerky.

190
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I love you so much.

191
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You know, this is good.

192
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Tomorrow night, more cheese for us.

193
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
No, no.

194
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Everybody's coming.

195
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm just not going to let Ray's opinion affect me.

196
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Okay, good, good.

197
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Hey, you know what?

198
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Don't even talk to him.

199
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
In fact, just stay quiet all night.

200
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We won't even

201
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
give him a chance to think that way about you.

202
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Huh?

203
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Oh.

204
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Robert,

205
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
when I was just telling

206
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
you my sweater story,

207
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
and you told me to...

208
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Was that because you think I talk too much?

209
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
No, no.

210
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That's because

211
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Raymond brought it up.

212
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You know, and I didn't want him to think that he was right.

213
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Because, you know, like you said,

214
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
jerky.

215
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And I love this new sweater.

216
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's a great sweater.

217
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Great story about the sweater.

218
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm stealing that story!

219
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

220
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Amy, Amy, wait, wait.

221
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Amy!

222
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The one time I get a word in.

223
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Okay, we have two different kinds of cheeses,

224
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
and the chocolate is for all the fruit.

225
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Move it, lady, I'm going in.

226
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Hello!

227
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Oh, hi!

228
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Oh, Amy, everything smells great.

229
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's what I said.

230
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Marie, here is the garlic

231
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
toast I made for dipping.

232
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Oh, thank you.

233
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Hey, Mary.

234
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Listen,

235
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I began about before.

236
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Sorry.

237
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Oh, you don't have to apologize to me.

238
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Ray, can I talk to you for a second?

239
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Hey.

240
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Sup, sis?

241
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Listen, Ray.

242
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Robert told me about what happened yesterday,

243
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
and I just want to let you know that

244
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
you're right.

245
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I should have realized you're just a guy,

246
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
and guys just want to relax

247
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
and watch TV, and I should have left you alone.

248
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Amy, will you marry me?

249
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You know, listen, Amy.

250
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Oh, no, no, no, Ray. I don't want things to be weird

251
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
between us, so I'm sorry.

252
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Well, me too.

253
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Great.

254
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Let's sit and eat.

255
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Okay, all right.

256
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I don't mind if I fondue.

257
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I got a cheese one.

258
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Wait a minute!

259
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
That's it?

260
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's fine, Robert.

261
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Let me get this straight.

262
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Raymond insults you,

263
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
but you get mad at me,

264
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
and then you apologize to him?

265
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What are you, taking lessons from my mom?

266
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Who I am?

267
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
My love?

268
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
What's going on?

269
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'll tell you what's going on.

270
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Yesterday, poor Raymond had to watch a basketball game

271
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
while Amy dared to sit next to him,

272
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
and then the minute she leaves,

273
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
he tells me that she had the nerve to talk to him

274
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
about things that didn't interest him,

275
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
called her Boxy Chatterhead.

276
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Why would you call Amy a Boxy Chatterhead?

277
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's Lady Chatterley.

278
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's from a book.

279
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's okay.

280
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
To be fair, Ray is a sports writer.

281
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's kind of like I was bothering him at work.

282
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Oh, Amy, no.

283
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
No, Ray doesn't work.

284
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Apologize to Amy right now.

285
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Excuse me.

286
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
This is between me and Amy,

287
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
and we're fine with it.

288
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Amy, kudos on the fondue.

289
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:38,000
This is not between you and Amy.

290
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
What, are you kidding me?

291
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You never listen, ever.

292
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Never ever?

293
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Oh, don't try to lay it all on Ray, Robert.

294
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Last night, you made it very clear

295
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
that you think I talk too much.

296
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Oh, dude.

297
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You're the one who should be in trouble.

298
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yeah, Ray.

299
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I know I think it,

300
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
but this chocolate and salami is a great combo.

301
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
All right, let's all just relax.

302
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I think we're making too big a deal of this.

303
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Oh, no, Amy, I have been putting up with this

304
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
for 15 years.

305
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I am not gonna let him do this to you, too.

306
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You know, when I need to talk to Ray

307
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
about, like, my feelings or our children,

308
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I know I have until the commercial's over.

309
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
That gives me 30 seconds.

310
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And if there's a girl in the commercial

311
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
who wants big wheels

312
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
or, God forbid, a monkey,

313
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
forget it.

314
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Come on, it's not true.

315
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Look, Ray, we're not asking for that much.

316
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's just talking and listening.

317
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Watch. Hello, Robert.

318
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Oh, hello there, Deborah. How's it going?

319
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Not so good. I've got a brother

320
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
who lacks even rudimentary social skills.

321
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm sorry to hear that.

322
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Well, thanks for asking.

323
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'll take my earrings.

324
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yeah.

325
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Oh, that was very good.

326
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Raymond, do it with me now.

327
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Hello, Raymond.

328
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Hello, Mother.

329
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Oh, look, Mom, a bear in pants.

330
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yes, your brother is quite hairy.

331
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
No, Ma, he's not doing it right.

332
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yes, yes, he is, Ma.

333
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
He's also ugly.

334
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
He should really wear a welder's mask.

335
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Why don't I weld your mouth to your ass

336
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
and make a donut out of you?

337
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You don't even know how to weld.

338
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm a damn fine welder.

339
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Oh, you're stinking everywhere.

340
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm gonna weld the couch for you.

341
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
This is nothing to fight about.

342
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Ray, just apologize to Amy.

343
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
No, it's okay.

344
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
We already talked about it.

345
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And now it just seems like everybody's using it

346
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
as an excuse to attack him.

347
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.

348
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
These jackals, they pounce as soon as they smell blood.

349
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
They love it when I'm miserable.

350
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I know you guys have been sending her in

351
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
every day on purpose just to annoy me.

352
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Amy.

353
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Even I know you gotta go in there.

354
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Yeah.

355
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Hey.

356
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
What are you doing?

357
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Just having some cookies.

358
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Listen, uh,

359
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I didn't mean what I said in there, really.

360
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I was just, you know, I'm mad at those guys.

361
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And I'm sorry.

362
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's okay.

363
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Listen, you definitely have a right to be mad at me.

364
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Oh, I do?

365
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I do?

366
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Well, thank you very much, Ray.

367
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You're welcome.

368
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Let me tell you something, mister.

369
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You are a frustrating person.

370
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
All this time I've been trying to talk to you

371
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
and it's like I'm banging my head against the wall.

372
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And I keep thinking, what's wrong with me?

373
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Why can't I get through to him?

374
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And now I realize that maybe it's not my fault.

375
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Maybe it's just that you're boring.

376
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Maybe it's just that you're boring.

377
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You know,

378
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Debra says you're like this because you don't want to talk.

379
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
But I think maybe it's because

380
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
you've got nothing to say.

381
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I do, too, have stuff to say.

382
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Oh, yeah? Go ahead.

383
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Come on, talk.

384
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Come on, talk. Right now.

385
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And I want something more than hot dogs

386
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
and football kicking.

387
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Yeah, oh!

388
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Interesting conversation.

389
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
What else do you have to say, Mr. Fascinating?

390
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
This is a lot of pressure!

391
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That's what I thought.

392
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm sorry.

393
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I was just lashing out.

394
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Oh, I stink at this.

395
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I was just trying to hurt your feelings.

396
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Good job.

397
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You want a tissue?

398
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm not crying.

399
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Look, Ray,

400
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I know

401
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I try too hard

402
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
talking about emotions and stuff.

403
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's just that

404
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I want to be close to everyone in this family.

405
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Why?

406
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Because I love you guys.

407
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
But, I mean, for gosh

408
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
sakes, I know Frank better than I know you.

409
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
All his sights

410
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
and sounds and smells.

411
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
But at least I know he's comfortable with me.

412
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I feel closer to him now.

413
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yeah, don't get

414
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
too close.

415
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
We lost the canary once.

416
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You're always so funny.

417
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You know what?

418
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's taken some time.

419
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Even Robert has started opening up to me.

420
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Like, he finally told me why he sleeps

421
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
with a tennis racket under his bed.

422
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
He still does that?

423
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
For the burglars.

424
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That's what he told you

425
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
it's for? No, no, no, no, no.

426
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
That's...

427
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That's his ghost swatter.

428
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
What? Yes, yes, yeah.

429
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Ever since we were kids, he would...

430
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Listen to this. One time,

431
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
he was about 12, and he thought he heard something in the attic.

432
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And so, of course, I'm making fun of him.

433
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So, to prove that he's not scared,

434
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
he went up there with his ghost swatter.

435
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So I took a broom, and I went

436
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
boom, boom, boom, and all of a sudden,

437
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
two giant legs come crashing through the ceiling.

438
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Boom!

439
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Just his legs? Yeah, well, he fell on a beam.

440
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It was just two giant legs just sticking out,

441
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
but they were still trying to run.

442
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Was he injured?

443
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Well, you tell me.

444
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Yeah.

445
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Hey, Amy, is, uh,

446
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
everything okay? Yeah.

447
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Everything's fine, Robert. Amy and I,

448
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
we were just talking.

449
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Yeah, we were. Uh-huh.

450
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Oh, great. Well, that's very nice.

451
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

452
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Well, please, by all means,

453
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
don't let me interrupt.

454
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Okay.

455
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Why aren't you talking?

456
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Why aren't you talking?

457
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
What were you talking about?

458
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Well, nothing. Shut up, really.

459
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What were you talking about, Amy?

460
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Under date night.

461
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Was this about me?

462
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
What did you tell him?

463
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You told him stuff about me. What did you say?

464
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Nothing, Robert. He got stuff out of you.

465
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I know him. Robert, we were just...

466
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Hey, come on, Amy, we should get in there.

467
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Dad's probably got the fondue pot on his head

468
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
like Winnie the Pooh.

469
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't lie to me.

470
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Is this about how I eat my foods

471
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
in alphabetical order? Because I have a very good reason

472
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
for that. I didn't know you'd

473
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
do that. I don't!

474
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Amy, I don't want you talking

475
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
to him. Did you tell him about my pedicures?

476
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
No, Robert.

477
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I didn't.

478
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Robert paints his feet

479
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
like a lady!

480
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Holy crap!

481
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
This commercial's funny.

482
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Right, watch. Watch what the cat does.

483
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
He high-fives the dog.

484
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
That's funny. Those two don't usually get along.

485
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Why don't you just sleep with him already?

486
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I've been sitting here

487
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
all night too, you know.

488
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Oh, look, this one's

489
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
got a monkey in it.

490
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
.

491
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
.

492
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
.

493
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
.

494
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
.

495
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
.

496
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
.

497
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
.

498
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
.

499
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
.

500
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
.

501
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
.

502
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
.

503
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
.

504
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
.

505
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
.

506
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
.

507
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
.

508
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
.

509
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
.

510
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
.
