1
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:02,759
Ha!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,660
Hi, Ray!

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:06,500
Oh, hey.

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,400
Oh, uh, Deb's not here.

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,660
She's out with the kids, so I'm just, you know,

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,480
trying to make the best of it.

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,019
Yeah.

8
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:17,980
Come.

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,179
Oh. Oh, okay.

10
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:23,300
Yeah.

11
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,600
I'm just gonna watch the Nick game, you know,

12
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,800
and, uh, nothing else.

13
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:29,780
Great.

14
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:31,820
Yeah, Robert called and told me you guys were gonna

15
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,799
watch the game when he got home from work, so I thought

16
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:35,439
I'd wait for him over here. Is that okay?

17
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:37,659
Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah.

18
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,240
All right.

19
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:43,939
So, so, uh, when did Robert say

20
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:44,859
he was gonna come home?

21
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:46,600
An hour.

22
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,659
Are you excited

23
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:56,719
about fondue date night?

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,200
Yeah.

25
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,219
What, what, what, what?

26
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,659
You guys are coming over tomorrow night

27
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:08,079
for Amy's first annual fondue night.

28
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:10,299
It's gonna be just the three of our own couples.

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,420
Like a triple date.

30
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:12,299
Hey.

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,879
Yeah, a date with my parents.

32
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,359
I know you think it's corny,

33
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,939
but it'll be fun. Really.

34
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,480
Fondue date night.

35
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,180
Yeah.

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,680
Yeah, fun.

37
00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:29,480
Talk to Robert about it

38
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,099
when he gets here in, uh, 58 minutes.

39
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,099
May I?

40
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:37,180
Oh. Oh, yeah.

41
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,840
Oh, look.

42
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,980
This one looks like a heart.

43
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,060
So from now on,

44
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,540
that's where I'm buying all my sweaters.

45
00:01:58,299 --> 00:01:58,739
Hey.

46
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,000
Hey, there he is.

47
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:00,739
There he is.

48
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,879
Hi, sweetie.

49
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:03,959
Missed you.

50
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:05,099
Yeah, what's up?

51
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,480
We've been waiting an hour and 11 minutes.

52
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:10,439
Uh, Amy, Ma wanted me to remind you

53
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,180
that you'll be making the salad for the dinner tonight.

54
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,259
Oh, I forgot.

55
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,120
I better go. Darn.

56
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,120
Yeah, damn it.

57
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,439
See you later, Yogi.

58
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:22,560
And, Ray, I'll see you at fondue.

59
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:25,319
Oh.

60
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,099
Okay, yeah.

61
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:29,360
This is such a cutie pie.

62
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:29,840
Yeah.

63
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,180
Oh, it's the second half already?

64
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,960
Yeah, man, you're missing some great basketball.

65
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:34,759
Yeah.

66
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,139
Actually, I kind of missed some, too.

67
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,360
I was, uh...

68
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,819
Me and Amy, we had a nice, long...

69
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,180
chat.

70
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:46,819
All right.

71
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:48,960
That's really nice. What did you guys talk about?

72
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:50,560
Oh, gosh, pretty much everything, I think.

73
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:50,979
Yeah.

74
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,219
Uh, Amy's great, huh?

75
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:55,659
Yeah, Amy's great. She's great.

76
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:56,419
Yeah.

77
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,620
She's kind of like a little Lady Chatterley.

78
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,800
Lady Chatterley?

79
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:07,659
Yeah.

80
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,520
What do you mean?

81
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,340
Oh, you know, like, she always wants to know

82
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,539
who everybody is, and she gets real excited

83
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:16,039
about fondue date night.

84
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,580
And she told me about

85
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,639
this interesting sales girl that sold her a sweater.

86
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,280
And, you know, whatever.

87
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:22,979
It's all good stuff.

88
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:23,580
It's all good.

89
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,599
Are you saying that Amy talks too much?

90
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:34,719
No, Robert, I love Amy.

91
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,240
Wow, are you a liar.

92
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:42,800
You know, I know what it is.

93
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:45,759
I got something good, and you can't stand it.

94
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,680
Oh, you never could.

95
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,580
Remember when I made that diorama

96
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,139
in Mr. Carolyn's history class?

97
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:50,620
What?

98
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,620
Everybody said how great it was.

99
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,219
Everybody!

100
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,199
I won a prize, remember?

101
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,020
But you said it stunk.

102
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,659
You had George Washington fighting a dinosaur.

103
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,060
It was a dragon, Raymond!

104
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,280
A dragon

105
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,039
that represented years

106
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,419
of British tyranny!

107
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,199
Which just goes to show

108
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,139
how stupid you were then and now.

109
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:16,560
Robert, I didn't...

110
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,019
Everybody thinks my wife is great.

111
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:18,360
Everybody!

112
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,379
So you have to tell me

113
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:26,540
that she's a lady chatterbox

114
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,439
who won't shut up?

115
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,500
I know how it goes.

116
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,339
Jealous ass.

117
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,639
Jealous!

118
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:37,279
Yes!

119
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,560
Stop it, no!

120
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,160
Come on, don't go, Robert, stay!

121
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,139
Stay and watch the game!

122
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:46,360
You want to say something bad

123
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,319
about my wife, you can.

124
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:48,019
I don't care.

125
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,600
Ah, come on!

126
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,379
Say it, say it!

127
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,939
She's a bad cook and she's mean!

128
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,079
Hey,

129
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,160
one second, one second.

130
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,860
And you may think that, Robert,

131
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,259
but you'll be dead wrong!

132
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:06,879
Dead wrong!

133
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,480
Deborah is a caring, beautiful,

134
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,360
skinny person.
