I came down this morning, she was making me a cheese omelet.

110
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:31,633
I mean, she hasn't done that since before Allie was born.

111
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:36,500
I mean, yeah, it had shells in it, but still.

112
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,233
You know what I've discovered?

113
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:41,267
The power of no.

114
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:43,567
Oh, the power of no. Give me a break.

115
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:45,433
Hey, hey, hey, who gets to hit a bucket of balls

116
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:47,367
in the middle of the day?

117
00:05:47,367 --> 00:05:49,067
Yeah, well, that's just the difference

118
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:50,633
between me and you, Raymond.

119
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:52,900
You know, you like to golf by yourself

120
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,667
and have a crappy omelet, while I prefer sex.

121
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:58,533
No, man, you're not getting it.

122
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:00,300
No, man, you're not getting it.

123
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,067
No, man, you're not getting it.

124
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:04,100
Deborah can't keep her hands off me.

125
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,767
It's like with the power of no comes the power of yes.

126
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:08,667
It's like with the power of no comes the power of yes.

127
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:10,167
Uh-huh.

128
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:11,433
For the first time in my marriage,

129
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:12,767
I finally know what it's like

130
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:16,200
to be the one wearing the panties.

131
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:23,500
You have a wrong.

132
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,900
No, no, no, no, no, no, I don't.

133
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,067
No, no, no, no, no, no, I don't.

134
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:28,200
But let me ask you something.

135
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,533
But let me ask you something.

136
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:31,767
Why do you always feel the need

137
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:32,800
Because I'm not very good at it.

138
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,067
Because I'm not very good at it.

139
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:37,600
Not very good at what?

140
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,900
Not very good at what?

141
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,700
Hey, listen, Robert, he can't go hit balls,

142
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,233
but I was thinking that I'd still go.

143
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:43,967
but I was thinking that I'd still go.

144
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,067
Yeah, sure, go. Have a good time.

145
00:06:50,967 --> 00:06:52,167
Hey, you know what?

146
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:53,433
Hey, you know what?

147
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:54,933
They got a great hot dog guy there.

148
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:57,767
You want me to bring you back one?

149
00:06:57,767 --> 00:07:01,067
Hey, you let me be the one to watch your figure.

150
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:03,200
Hey, you let me be the one to watch your figure.

151
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,867
Let me watch your figure?

152
00:07:06,867 --> 00:07:08,300
That's not funny.

153
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:13,867
That's right, it's not, and yet it is.

154
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:16,133
Because she is weak.

155
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:19,733
Weak for my physique.

156
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:25,600
Oh.

157
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,867
Oh, don't those look nice?

158
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:51,267
Oh, don't those look nice?

159
00:07:51,267 --> 00:07:52,933
Yeah.

160
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:54,333
putting them up yesterday.

161
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,433
Well, he can't handle normal-sized tools

162
00:07:56,433 --> 00:08:00,200
with those giant fingers.

163
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,933
Here, push that curtain over a little

164
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:06,267
so we don't see his blood.

165
00:08:06,267 --> 00:08:07,933
So what do you think, Deb?

166
00:08:07,933 --> 00:08:09,800
Yeah, they look great.

167
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,067
Deborah, dear, you're being so quiet.

168
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:13,833
Deborah, dear, you're being so quiet.

169
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,600
That's not like you.

170
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,833
No, I'm fine.

171
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,367
Do I look different to you?

172
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:23,700
What do you mean?

173
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,067
What do you mean?

174
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:30,533
Have I drooped?

175
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:31,900
Drooped?

176
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,300
You know, you try to work out

177
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,067
and yet there still comes a day

178
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:41,133
when everything just...

179
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:44,667
I wouldn't know about that.

180
00:08:47,433 --> 00:08:49,700
Oh, stop it, Deb.

181
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,867
You look great.

182
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:55,200
Water aerobics at the Y.

183
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,800
Water aerobics at the Y.

184
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Oh, well, I'll have to check and see if I'm free.

185
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,500
Oh, well, have a ball.

186
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,733
Let me go look for an extra pair of nose clips

187
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:07,400
and a swim cap.

188
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:18,167
Deb, are you really upset about this?

189
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:25,133
Ray keeps turning me down.

190
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:28,067
What do you mean?

191
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,633
Yeah.

192
00:09:29,633 --> 00:09:32,067
That doesn't sound like him.

193
00:09:32,067 --> 00:09:33,433
I know.

194
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:37,967
I'm sure it's not you.

195
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:40,867
I'm sure it's not you.

196
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:43,100
I wish he was.

197
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,733
Oh, man.

198
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:46,733
Oh, man.

199
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:48,200
I should just go with Marie to the Y,

200
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,500
or a swim cap,

201
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,267
Hey, you know,

202
00:09:55,267 --> 00:09:57,533
because last night when Robert and I went to bed,

203
00:09:57,533 --> 00:10:00,733
he was acting kind of distant, too.

204
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,933
But then I just kissed his neck,

205
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:06,967
and he said, Ray's crazy.

206
00:10:06,967 --> 00:10:08,200
He did?

207
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,233
He did?

208
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:12,567
And then he said something about how I could have all the power.

209
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:14,100
It was weird.

210
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,367
It was weird.

211
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:23,167
I mean, why would he s...

212
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:25,033
Oh, my God.

213
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:28,900
Oh, no.

214
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,767
Oh, my God.

215
00:10:30,767 --> 00:10:31,800
I know.

216
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,233
I know.

217
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,800
I know.

218
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,067
I know.

219
00:10:39,067 --> 00:10:40,933
I know.

220
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:44,800
I know.

221
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,967
I know.

222
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:50,833
Well, that's gross.

223
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,100
Of course, I am.

224
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,333
You know, the worst part about this is that it worked.

225
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,233
You know, the worst part about this is that it worked.

226
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:57,967
I've been trying to make myself look better for him.

227
00:10:57,967 --> 00:10:59,500
I've been trying to make myself look better for him.

228
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,533
I've been trying to make myself look better for him.

229
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:04,067
Do you know I did 138 sit ups this morning all for some guy whose stomach looks like

230
00:11:04,067 --> 00:11:05,333
Do you know I did 138 sit ups this morning all for some guy whose stomach looks like

231
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:10,067
a deflated clown balloon?

232
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:12,600
Boy, boy.

233
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,933
You're gonna kill him, aren't you?

234
00:11:13,933 --> 00:11:18,067
No.

235
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:27,733
Hey, Jimmy Jack.

236
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:29,067
Hey, Jimmy Jack.

237
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:30,067
Hey. How was work?

238
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:31,900
Hey. How was work?

239
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,400
Good. Where are the kids?

240
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,400
I sent them over to the Parker's.

241
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,800
Why?

242
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,500
I wanted them out of the house.

243
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,067
Oh, yeah?

244
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:44,067
I didn't think it would be appropriate for the children

245
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:47,433
to see what I was going to do to you.

246
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:49,967
Right now, I don't know.

247
00:11:49,967 --> 00:11:53,400
I mean, I got a lot to do.

248
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,133
Really, Deb, I think...

249
00:11:55,133 --> 00:12:01,100
Really, Deb, I think...

250
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,667
Yeah, yeah, well...

251
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:07,567
Yeah, yeah, well...

252
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:10,433
Okay, look, I'm really starting to feel a little uncomfortable.

253
00:12:10,433 --> 00:12:12,567
Okay, look, I'm really starting to feel a little uncomfortable.

254
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:17,567
What's with you?

255
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:20,167
What's with you?

256
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:24,733
Robert told Amy why you've been turning me down.

257
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:27,067
So you were just toying with me?

258
00:12:27,067 --> 00:12:28,967
So you were just toying with me?

259
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:30,467
Getting me to beg for sex?

260
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:32,633
That makes you feel good?

261
00:12:32,633 --> 00:12:34,233
No. No, I don't know. I just...

262
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:36,567
I guess I wanted to see what it was like

263
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:38,933
to be the one being pursued for once.

264
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:40,300
But you made me feel terrible about myself.

265
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,533
You just kept rejecting me.

266
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:45,267
How could you do that to somebody?

267
00:12:45,267 --> 00:12:49,367
You had me convinced I was a fat, ugly old lady.

268
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:51,967
Well, now you know how I feel.

269
00:12:51,967 --> 00:12:54,867
You feel bad because I turned you down, what, three times?

270
00:12:54,867 --> 00:12:57,700
Try being rejected 40 or 50 times every year

271
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,067
for the last ten years.

272
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:00,333
for the last ten years.

273
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,500
How do you think that feels?

274
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,067
You're looking at the president

275
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:06,600
Welcome. Have a doughnut.

276
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,800
Welcome. Have a doughnut.

277
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,433
And I say yes a lot.

278
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:13,433
Exactly. You say yes, and you say no.

279
00:13:13,433 --> 00:13:15,733
You're the bouncer.

280
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:17,467
You're the bouncer in front of the disco

281
00:13:17,467 --> 00:13:19,533
who decides who gets in and who doesn't.

282
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:21,200
And for once, it was you standing outside.

283
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,733
Yeah, and you couldn't take it.

284
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:24,200
Yeah, and you couldn't take it.

285
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,800
Yeah, it's cold out there, isn't it?

286
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,133
Standing in the rain with your bad shirt

287
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:30,367
and your acne pimples.

288
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:31,567
There is no way you can compare me turning you down

289
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:33,067
with what you did to me.

290
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:34,667
with what you did to me.

291
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:37,867
Listen, Ray, if I turn you down,

292
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:42,100
of three kids all day and thinking

293
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,833
Still using the kids, huh?

294
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,867
Oh, my God.

295
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,900
I don't think I ever wanted to have sex with you.

296
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,600
Yeah, well, you don't have to worry,

297
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,633
because I'm not sure the next time

298
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:54,700
Oh, you're threatening me with no sex, please.

299
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,200
Oh, you're threatening me with no sex, please.

300
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,600
Yeah, you will be saying please.

301
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,067
I'm serious.

302
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:03,433
I'm serious.

303
00:14:03,433 --> 00:14:05,367
You are always in the mood.

304
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:07,200
You wouldn't last a night.

305
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,567
I just did three nights, Lady Pantaloons.

306
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:13,900
Okay, so we'll see who can't last.

307
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,200
Oh, my.

308
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,900
How will I ever resist my baser instincts?

309
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,467
Yeah, I like that.

310
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:20,867
I like the Southern thing.

311
00:14:20,867 --> 00:14:22,600
I like the Southern thing.

312
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,067
That'll be good when you come back saying

313
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,767
Okay, well, good enough.

314
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:43,700
Ugh.

315
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:11,067
Oh, my God.

316
00:15:11,067 --> 00:15:13,600
Are those silk?

317
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,333
You want a feel?

318
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,267
It's quite all right.

319
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:25,600
What's with all your lacy apparel?

320
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,867
Nothing.

321
00:15:26,867 --> 00:15:28,233
Nothing.

322
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,800
Good night.

323
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,500
Good night.

324
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,567
Yeah.

325
00:15:56,567 --> 00:15:59,700
I'm a little tired, too.

326
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:09,567
Did you put oil on?

327
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:11,067
No.

328
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:14,200
No.

329
00:16:37,633 --> 00:16:39,767
What are you doing?

330
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:41,433
Me?

331
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,967
What'd you have my mom put on?

332
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:48,267
Your makeup on?

333
00:16:48,267 --> 00:16:52,767
No sex for you.

334
00:16:55,367 --> 00:17:01,500
¶¶

335
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,067
All right, you win!

336
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,933
What?

337
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:18,433
I give up!

338
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:21,800
I am officially asking you to please

339
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,633
What are you talking about?

340
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:26,933
Our thing!

341
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:28,700
Our not-having-sex thing!

342
00:18:32,533 --> 00:18:34,367
Of course we're still doing it.

343
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,967
Of course we're still doing it.

344
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:37,567
It's been 26 days of doing it.

345
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:40,733
Not doing it!

346
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,233
Yeah, right!

347
00:18:44,233 --> 00:18:45,600
Yeah, right!

348
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,700
I can't believe it, but really,

349
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,233
I totally forgot.

350
00:18:49,233 --> 00:18:51,633
You expect me to believe that you didn't realize

351
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:55,067
that we went 26 days without having sex?

352
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,767
I've been really busy.

353
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:02,500
I've been really busy.

354
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,433
The PTA fundraiser is coming up.

355
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,900
26 days?

356
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,733
You weren't even trying.

357
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:21,733
Guess I was never really close to having the power,

358
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:23,533
was I?

359
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:28,333
All this time,

360
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,700
I thought you were doing all those

361
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,067
little things to torture me.

362
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:34,533
What things?

363
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:36,067
Forget it.

364
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:37,700
No, come on.

365
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,867
No, like biting your lower lip

366
00:19:38,867 --> 00:19:40,800
No, like biting your lower lip

367
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,567
when you use the remote to change the channel.

368
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:45,267
Or how about when you keep

369
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,433
one of your legs outside of the covers

370
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:50,500
and the pajama rides up it?

371
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,600
That's just because I'm hot.

372
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,367
Even when you sleep,

373
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:57,800
every so often you kind of sigh a little.

374
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,367
every so often you kind of sigh a little.

375
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,367
You haven't slept much lately, have you?

376
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,533
You haven't slept much lately, have you?

377
00:20:05,533 --> 00:20:07,033
Even now,

378
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:08,767
Even now,

379
00:20:08,767 --> 00:20:11,033
look at you,

380
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:13,700
with your hair like that,

381
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,600
with your...

382
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:19,900
robe.

383
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,100
What a mess!

384
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,000
Yeah, well,

385
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:32,800
What?

386
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,633
What?

387
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:38,167
You just got a little of your power back.

388
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:40,933
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

389
00:20:40,933 --> 00:20:44,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

390
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,500
Are you toying with me?

391
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,333
Because if you are,

392
00:20:50,567 --> 00:20:52,900
I've been waiting for this for a long time, too, Ray.

393
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,733
I've been waiting for this for a long time, too, Ray.

394
00:20:56,733 --> 00:21:03,067
it's been 27 days, not 26.

395
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:04,867
Remember.

396
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:07,867
Remember.

397
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:12,067
Morning, kids.

398
00:21:12,067 --> 00:21:15,167
Well, you live here.

399
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:17,200
No!

400
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,067
Hey, you guys can make breakfast yourself, right?

401
00:21:19,067 --> 00:21:22,300
Hey, you guys can make breakfast yourself, right?

402
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,633
Eh?

403
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:29,133
Eh?
