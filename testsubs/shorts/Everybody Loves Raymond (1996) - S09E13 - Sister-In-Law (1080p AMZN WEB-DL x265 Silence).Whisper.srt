1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ha!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hi, Ray!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Oh, hey.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Oh, uh, Deb's not here.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
She's out with the kids, so I'm just, you know,

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
trying to make the best of it.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yeah.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Come.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Oh. Oh, okay.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm just gonna watch the Nick game, you know,

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and, uh, nothing else.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Great.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah, Robert called and told me you guys were gonna watch the game

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
when he got home from work,

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
so I thought I'd wait for him over here.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Is that okay?

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
All right.

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So, so, uh,

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
when did Robert say he was gonna come home?

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
About an hour.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Are you excited about what's next?

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yeah.

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
A fondue date night?

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What, what, what, what?

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You guys are coming over tomorrow night

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
for Amy's first annual fondue night.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's gonna be just the three of our own couples.

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Like a triple date.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Hey.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yeah, a date with my parents.

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I know you think it's corny, but it'll be fun.

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Really.

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Fondue date night.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah.

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You don't want to, uh,

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
talk to Robert about it

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
when he gets here in, uh, 58 minutes.

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
May I?

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Oh. Oh, yeah.

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Oh, look,

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
this one looks like a heart.

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So from now on,

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
that's where I'm buying all my sweaters.

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
There he is.

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Hey, there he is. There he is.

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Hi, sweetie.

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Missed you.

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah, what's up? We've been waiting an hour and 11 minutes.

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Uh, Amy,

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Ma wanted me to remind you that you'll be making the salad

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
for the dinner tonight.

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Oh, I forgot. I better go. Darn.

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yeah, damn it.

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
See you later, Yogi.

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And Ray, I'll see you

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
at fondue.

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Okay, yeah.

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is such a cutie pie.

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah.

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Oh, it's the second half already?

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah, man. You're missing some great basketball.

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah.

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Actually, I kind of missed some, too.

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It was, uh, me and Amy,

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
we had a nice, long

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
chat.

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
All right. That's really nice.

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What did you guys talk about?

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh, gosh, pretty much everything, I think.

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Uh, Amy's great, huh?

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yeah, Amy's great. She's great.

74
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah.

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
She's kind of like a little

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Lady Chatterley.

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Lady Chatterley?

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yeah. What do you mean?

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh, you know, like, she always

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
wants to know where everybody is,

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
and she gets real excited about fondue

82
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
date night.

83
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And she told me about this interesting sales girl

84
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and told her a sweater and, you know,

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
whatever. It's all good stuff.

86
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's all good.

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Are you saying that Amy talks too much?

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No, Robert, I love Amy.

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Wow, are you a liar.

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You know, I know what it is.

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I got something good, and you can't stand it.

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh, you never could. Remember when I made

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
that diorama in Mr. Carolyn's history class?

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What?

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Everybody said how great it was.

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Everybody!

97
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I won a prize, remember?

98
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But you said it stunk.

99
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You had George Washington fighting a dinosaur.

100
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It was a dragon, Raymond!

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
A dragon that represented

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
years of British tyranny!

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Which just goes to show how stupid

104
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
you were then and now.

105
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Uh, Robert, I didn't...

106
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Everybody!

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So you have to tell me that she's a lady

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
chatterbox who won't shut up?

109
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I know how it goes.

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Jealous

111
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
ass.

112
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Jealous!

113
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes!

114
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Stop it. No.

115
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
No, come on. Don't go, Robert.

116
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Stay. Stay and watch the game.

117
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Come on. You want to say something

118
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
bad about my wife, you can. I don't care.

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Oh, come on.

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Say it.

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Say it.

122
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
She's a bad cook and she's mean.

123
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Hey.

124
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
All right.

125
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
All right. One second. One second.

126
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And you may think that, Robert,

127
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
but you'll be dead wrong.

128
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Dead wrong!

129
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Deborah is a caring,

130
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
beautiful, skinny person.
