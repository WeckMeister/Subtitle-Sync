1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,333
- Hey, good mornin'.
- Hey.

2
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:05,200
When did you
finally come to bed?

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,933
'Cause I thought
you were coming right up,

4
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:08,433
but then I fell asleep.

5
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:10,300
- Yeah, the game,
it went into double overtime.

6
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,167
It was amazing.
- Oh...

7
00:00:12,167 --> 00:00:15,233
'Cause I thought
we had plans.

8
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:20,233
- Sorry. God...

9
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:21,733
- Did you catch
the end of that game?

10
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:22,833
- Oh, it was amazing.

11
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:24,400
- See?
- All right.

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,233
Well, I'll let you boys
talk about your exciting sports.

13
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:30,333
I just hope there's
not a game on tonight.

14
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:37,100
- Huh.
- What?

15
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,800
- I think she just
gave me the look.

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,167
- What do you mean?

17
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:46,000
- You know...

18
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:51,233
Sex.

19
00:00:51,233 --> 00:00:54,267
- That face means "sex"?

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,033
I thought it meant "gas."

21
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:01,167
- She does it better, okay?

22
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:02,833
- Yeah, I know
when Amy's in the mood,

23
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:06,333
'cause she always gives me
this sexy little sideways smile.

24
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:10,400
- Yeah, yeah.

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,667
- I think Amy's saying,

26
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:14,700
"hurry up
and get it over with."

27
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:21,200
- Your mother's
got a look, too,

28
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,267
which is why after sunset,
I avoid all eye contact.

29
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:32,400
- It's weird, though.
It's weird.

30
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,500
Okay, last night,
I got the look.

31
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
But I got caught up
in the game,

32
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,900
so I stayed up to watch it
instead of going upstairs.

33
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,967
And now,
instead of being mad,

34
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:44,333
Debra gave me
the look again.

35
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:45,633
Huh.

36
00:01:45,633 --> 00:01:48,200
- Maybe--maybe I should

37
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,800
turn her down again,
you know?

38
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,567
- Why would you do
a silly thing like that?

39
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:55,767
- I don't know.

40
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:57,733
I mean, I'm always
the one being shot down.

41
00:01:57,733 --> 00:02:00,967
It felt good, her wondering
where I was last night.

42
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:02,933
- You can't turn her down.

43
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:05,067
- I-I could too
turn her down.

44
00:02:05,067 --> 00:02:06,300
- Oh, come on,
you follow her around

45
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,367
like a dog with
his tongue hanging out.

46
00:02:09,367 --> 00:02:11,167
- Yeah, your tongue
is the leash she uses

47
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:12,733
to parade you
around the park.

48
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,067
[Laughing]

49
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,800
- Ladies and gentlemen,
worst in show!

50
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,100
- Yeah, yeah.

51
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,633
Yeah, well, then maybe

52
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:21,367
that's why I should
turn her down.

53
00:02:21,367 --> 00:02:23,200
So she doesn't
take me for granted.

54
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,067
You know? I mean, she's got to
appreciate what she's got here.

55
00:02:27,067 --> 00:02:30,933
- Yes, you're quite a catch.

56
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:34,833
I can hardly
keep my hands off you.

57
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:38,467
Come on, come on!

58
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:40,533
- Stupid.

59
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:48,267
- Hey.
- Hey.

60
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:54,100
- Oh,
I left the hallway light on.

61
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,067
I'll be right back.

62
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:05,667
I can say "no."

63
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:07,367
I can say
"no."

64
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:25,167
- You already asleep?

65
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:28,667
- Huh? What?

66
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,067
- You must be tired.

67
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:32,067
- Oh, yeah,
I am kind of beat.

68
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:33,800
You know, I just--
I got a lot of...

69
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,900
Stuff...

70
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,600
...going on.

71
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,933
Maybe tomorrow.

72
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:47,067
- Really?

73
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:49,233
- Yeah...

74
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,833
- Okay.

75
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,767
Well, night.

76
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:58,067
- Yeah.

77
00:03:58,067 --> 00:04:00,633
[Yawns]
Good night.

78
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:13,100
Where were you, man?
Come on, let's go!

79
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,667
- Ah, I don't think I'm gonna
go hit balls today.

80
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:16,867
- What--what?

81
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:18,867
Oh, what, did the wife
say you can't go?

82
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:22,667
- No, no, just a little
stiff, that's all.

83
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:25,767
- Oh, so it's
a medical decision

84
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:28,433
you're making
to stay here and...

85
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:31,867
- Help Amy pick out drapes.

86
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:33,700
- [Chuckles]

87
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,467
Ah, drapes, yeah.

88
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:37,200
Well, if there's any
material left over,

89
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,700
why don't you make yourself
a little skirt?

90
00:04:46,367 --> 00:04:47,967
I'm still gonna go,
and you know what?

91
00:04:47,967 --> 00:04:50,600
I may go tomorrow, because
I can do whatever I want.

92
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,067
- What do you mean?

93
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:55,800
- All right, you thought I
couldn't turn down Debra, right?

94
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,367
Two times, my friend!

95
00:04:57,367 --> 00:04:59,067
Yeah, last night,
I told her

96
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:00,567
that I had a lot
of work to do today.

97
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:02,700
[Scoffs]
Work!

98
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,167
And then--and then,
first thing this morning,

99
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:06,467
she started hinting again.

100
00:05:06,467 --> 00:05:08,800
She even brushed her teeth
and everything,

101
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,067
but no sale!
