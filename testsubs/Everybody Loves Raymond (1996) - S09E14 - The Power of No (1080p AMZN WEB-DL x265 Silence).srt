1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,333
- Hey, good mornin'.
- Hey.

2
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:05,200
When did you
finally come to bed?

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,933
'Cause I thought
you were coming right up,

4
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:08,433
but then I fell asleep.

5
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:10,300
- Yeah, the game,
it went into double overtime.

6
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,167
It was amazing.
- Oh...

7
00:00:12,167 --> 00:00:15,233
'Cause I thought
we had plans.

8
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:20,233
- Sorry. God...

9
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:21,733
- Did you catch
the end of that game?

10
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:22,833
- Oh, it was amazing.

11
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:24,400
- See?
- All right.

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,233
Well, I'll let you boys
talk about your exciting sports.

13
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:30,333
I just hope there's
not a game on tonight.

14
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:37,100
- Huh.
- What?

15
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,800
- I think she just
gave me the look.

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,167
- What do you mean?

17
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:46,000
- You know...

18
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:51,233
Sex.

19
00:00:51,233 --> 00:00:54,267
- That face means "sex"?

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,033
I thought it meant "gas."

21
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:01,167
- She does it better, okay?

22
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:02,833
- Yeah, I know
when Amy's in the mood,

23
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:06,333
'cause she always gives me
this sexy little sideways smile.

24
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:10,400
- Yeah, yeah.

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,667
- I think Amy's saying,

26
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:14,700
"hurry up
and get it over with."

27
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:21,200
- Your mother's
got a look, too,

28
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,267
which is why after sunset,
I avoid all eye contact.

29
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:32,400
- It's weird, though.
It's weird.

30
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,500
Okay, last night,
I got the look.

31
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
But I got caught up
in the game,

32
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,900
so I stayed up to watch it
instead of going upstairs.

33
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,967
And now,
instead of being mad,

34
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:44,333
Debra gave me
the look again.

35
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:45,633
Huh.

36
00:01:45,633 --> 00:01:48,200
- Maybe--maybe I should

37
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,800
turn her down again,
you know?

38
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,567
- Why would you do
a silly thing like that?

39
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:55,767
- I don't know.

40
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:57,733
I mean, I'm always
the one being shot down.

41
00:01:57,733 --> 00:02:00,967
It felt good, her wondering
where I was last night.

42
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:02,933
- You can't turn her down.

43
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:05,067
- I-I could too
turn her down.

44
00:02:05,067 --> 00:02:06,300
- Oh, come on,
you follow her around

45
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,367
like a dog with
his tongue hanging out.

46
00:02:09,367 --> 00:02:11,167
- Yeah, your tongue
is the leash she uses

47
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:12,733
to parade you
around the park.

48
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,067
[Laughing]

49
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,800
- Ladies and gentlemen,
worst in show!

50
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,100
- Yeah, yeah.

51
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,633
Yeah, well, then maybe

52
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:21,367
that's why I should
turn her down.

53
00:02:21,367 --> 00:02:23,200
So she doesn't
take me for granted.

54
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,067
You know? I mean, she's got to
appreciate what she's got here.

55
00:02:27,067 --> 00:02:30,933
- Yes, you're quite a catch.

56
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:34,833
I can hardly
keep my hands off you.

57
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:38,467
Come on, come on!

58
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:40,533
- Stupid.

59
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:48,267
- Hey.
- Hey.

60
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:54,100
- Oh,
I left the hallway light on.

61
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,067
I'll be right back.

62
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:05,667
I can say "no."

63
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:07,367
I can say
"no."

64
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:25,167
- You already asleep?

65
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:28,667
- Huh? What?

66
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,067
- You must be tired.

67
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:32,067
- Oh, yeah,
I am kind of beat.

68
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:33,800
You know, I just--
I got a lot of...

69
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,900
Stuff...

70
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,600
...going on.

71
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,933
Maybe tomorrow.

72
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:47,067
- Really?

73
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:49,233
- Yeah...

74
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,833
- Okay.

75
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,767
Well, night.

76
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:58,067
- Yeah.

77
00:03:58,067 --> 00:04:00,633
[Yawns]
Good night.

78
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:13,100
Where were you, man?
Come on, let's go!

79
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,667
- Ah, I don't think I'm gonna
go hit balls today.

80
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:16,867
- What--what?

81
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:18,867
Oh, what, did the wife
say you can't go?

82
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:22,667
- No, no, just a little
stiff, that's all.

83
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:25,767
- Oh, so it's
a medical decision

84
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:28,433
you're making
to stay here and...

85
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:31,867
- Help Amy pick out drapes.

86
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:33,700
- [Chuckles]

87
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,467
Ah, drapes, yeah.

88
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:37,200
Well, if there's any
material left over,

89
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,700
why don't you make yourself
a little skirt?

90
00:04:46,367 --> 00:04:47,967
I'm still gonna go,
and you know what?

91
00:04:47,967 --> 00:04:50,600
I may go tomorrow, because
I can do whatever I want.

92
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,067
- What do you mean?

93
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:55,800
- All right, you thought I
couldn't turn down Debra, right?

94
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,367
Two times, my friend!

95
00:04:57,367 --> 00:04:59,067
Yeah, last night,
I told her

96
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:00,567
that I had a lot
of work to do today.

97
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:02,700
[Scoffs]
Work!

98
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,167
And then--and then,
first thing this morning,

99
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:06,467
she started hinting again.

100
00:05:06,467 --> 00:05:08,800
She even brushed her teeth
and everything,

101
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,067
but no sale!

102
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:12,333
Ah, it's amazing, it's like--

103
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,867
it's like every time
I turn her down,

104
00:05:13,867 --> 00:05:15,067
she seems to want it more.

105
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:19,067
She's like a guy.

106
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:21,600
- Huh, and she's
not getting upset?

107
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,233
- No, no, no, that's just it.

108
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:25,900
She's been treating me
better all day.

109
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,067
I came in this morning, she
was making me a cheese omelet.

110
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:31,633
I mean, she hasn't done that
since before ally was born!

111
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:36,500
I mean, yeah,
it had shells in it, but still.

112
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,233
You know what
I've discovered?

113
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:41,267
The power of "no."

114
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:43,567
- "The power of 'no.'"
Give me a break.

115
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:45,433
- Hey, hey, hey, who gets to hit
a bucket of balls

116
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:47,367
in the middle of the day?

117
00:05:47,367 --> 00:05:49,067
- Yeah, well,
that's just the difference

118
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:50,633
between me and you,
Raymond.

119
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:52,900
You like to golf by yourself
and have a crappy omelet,

120
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,667
while I prefer sex.

121
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:58,533
- No.
- Yes.

122
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:00,300
- No.

123
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,067
No, man,
you're not gettin' it.

124
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:04,100
Debra can't
keep her hands off me.

125
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,767
It's like with
the power of "no"

126
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:08,667
comes the power of "yes."

127
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:10,167
Uh-huh.

128
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:11,433
For the first time
in my marriage,

129
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:12,767
I finally know
what it's like

130
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:16,200
to be the one
wearin' the panties.

131
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:23,500
- You have a wrong and
generally troubled relationship.

132
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,900
- No, no, no, no,
no, I don't.

133
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,067
It's very right.

134
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:28,200
- Then let me ask you something.

135
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,533
Why do you always
feel the need

136
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:31,767
to be manipulative
when it comes to sex?

137
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:32,800
- Because...

138
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,067
I'm not very good at it.

139
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:37,600
- You're not very good
at what?

140
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,900
- Oh, you name it.

141
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,700
Hey, listen, Robert--
he can't go hit balls,

142
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,233
but I was thinkin'
that I'd still go.

143
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:43,967
- Yeah, sure, go.
Have a good time.

144
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,067
- All right.

145
00:06:50,967 --> 00:06:52,167
Hey, you know what?

146
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:53,433
They got a great
hot dog guy there.

147
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:54,933
You want me
to bring you back one?

148
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:57,767
- No, I shouldn't.
I got to watch my figure.

149
00:06:57,767 --> 00:07:01,067
- Hey, you let me be the one
to watch your figure.

150
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:03,200
- [Giggles]

151
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,867
- "Let me watch your figure"?

152
00:07:06,867 --> 00:07:08,300
That's not funny.

153
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:13,867
- That's right, it's not,
and yet, it is!

154
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:16,133
Because she is weak.

155
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:19,733
Weak...for my physique.

156
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:25,600
[Clattering]

157
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,867
- Oh, don't those look nice?

158
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:51,267
- Yeah.

159
00:07:51,267 --> 00:07:52,933
I don't know why Robert
had such a hard time

160
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:54,333
putting them up yesterday.

161
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,433
- Well, he can't handle
normal-sized tools

162
00:07:56,433 --> 00:08:00,200
with those giant fingers.

163
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,933
Here, push that curtain over
a little

164
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:06,267
so we don't see his blood.

165
00:08:06,267 --> 00:08:07,933
- So what do you think,
Deb?

166
00:08:07,933 --> 00:08:09,800
- Yeah, they look great.

167
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,067
- Debra, dear.

168
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:13,833
You're being so quiet.

169
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,600
That's not like you.

170
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,833
- No, I'm fine, it's just--

171
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,367
do I look different
to you?

172
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:23,700
- What do you mean?

173
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,067
- I don't know,
I'm just feeling--

174
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:30,533
have I drooped?

175
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:31,900
- Drooped?

176
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,300
- You know, you try to work out
and take care of yourself,

177
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,067
and yet there still comes a day
when everything just...

178
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:41,133
[Mimics exploding sound]

179
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:44,667
- I wouldn't know about that.

180
00:08:47,433 --> 00:08:49,700
- Oh, stop it, Deb.
You look great.

181
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,867
- You know how my friends
and I keep fit?

182
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:55,200
Water aerobics at the "y."

183
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,800
Say, why don't you
come with us tomorrow?

184
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,800
- Oh, wow, I'll have to check
and see if I'm free.

185
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,500
- Oh, we'll have a ball!

186
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,733
Let me go look
for an extra pair of nose clips

187
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:07,400
and a swim cap.

188
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:18,167
- Debra, you're really
upset about this.

189
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:25,133
- Ray keeps turning me down.

190
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:28,067
- What do you mean, sex?
- Yeah.

191
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,633
- That doesn't sound like him.

192
00:09:29,633 --> 00:09:32,067
He usually follows you around
with his tongue hanging out.

193
00:09:32,067 --> 00:09:33,433
- I know.

194
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:37,967
- Well, I'm sure it's not you.

195
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:40,867
Hey, maybe he's sick.
- Nah.

196
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:43,100
I wish he was.

197
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,733
Oh, man, who am I kidding?

198
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:46,733
I should just go
with Marie to the "y,"

199
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:48,200
put on a flowery swim cap,

200
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,500
and float around
with the old ladies.

201
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,267
- You know, it's funny,
you bringing this up,

202
00:09:55,267 --> 00:09:57,533
because last night
when Robert and I went to bed,

203
00:09:57,533 --> 00:10:00,733
he was acting
kind of distant too.

204
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,933
But then I just
kissed his neck, and he said,

205
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:06,967
"Ray's crazy."

206
00:10:06,967 --> 00:10:08,200
- He did?

207
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,233
- Yeah, and then he said
something about

208
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:12,567
how I could have
all the power.

209
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:14,100
It was weird.

210
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,367
Yeah, he usually doesn't like
to mention ray in the bedroom.

211
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:23,167
He says it inhibits him.

212
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:25,033
- "The power"?

213
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:28,900
I mean, why would he say--

214
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,767
oh...

215
00:10:30,767 --> 00:10:31,800
- What?

216
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,233
- Oh, my god.

217
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,800
Oh, my god!

218
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,067
He has been
turning me down on purpose!

219
00:10:39,067 --> 00:10:40,933
- Oh, no,
why would he do that?

220
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:44,800
- For the power!

221
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,967
He thinks it gives him
the upper hand or something.

222
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:50,833
- Well, that's gross.

223
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,100
Hey, but look on
the bright side.

224
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,333
This means you're still hot.

225
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,233
- Of course I am.

226
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:57,967
You know what the worst part
about this is?

227
00:10:57,967 --> 00:10:59,500
That it worked.

228
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,533
I've been trying to make myself
look better for him.

229
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:04,067
Do you know I did
138 sit ups this morning?

230
00:11:04,067 --> 00:11:05,333
All for some guy
whose stomach

231
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:10,067
looks like a deflated
clown balloon!

232
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:12,600
- Oh, boy, you're gonna
kill him, aren't you?

233
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,933
- No.

234
00:11:13,933 --> 00:11:18,067
No, I want him alive.

235
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:27,733
- Hey, jimmyjack.

236
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:29,067
- Hey.

237
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:30,067
How was work?

238
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:31,900
- Good. Where are the kids?

239
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,400
- I sent them over
to the Parkers.

240
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,400
- Why?

241
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,800
- I wanted them
out of the house.

242
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,500
- Oh, yeah?

243
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,067
- I didn't think
it would be appropriate

244
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:44,067
for the children to see
what I was going to do to you.

245
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:47,433
- Oh, gosh, really, Deb?

246
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:49,967
Right now? I don't know.

247
00:11:49,967 --> 00:11:53,400
I mean, I got a lot to do.

248
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,133
Really, Deb, I think--

249
00:11:55,133 --> 00:12:01,100
- [whispers]
You're just so powerful.

250
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,667
- Yeah, yeah, well--

251
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:07,567
- I just can't resist a man
with so much power.

252
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:10,433
- Okay, look, I'm really
starting to feel a little--

253
00:12:10,433 --> 00:12:12,567
[screams]

254
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:17,567
What's with you?

255
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:20,167
- Robert told Amy
why you've been turning me down.

256
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:24,733
- I hate that guy!

257
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:27,067
- So you were
just toying with me,

258
00:12:27,067 --> 00:12:28,967
getting me to beg for sex?

259
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:30,467
That makes you feel good?

260
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:32,633
- No, no, I don't know,
I just--

261
00:12:32,633 --> 00:12:34,233
I guess I wanted
to see what it was like

262
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:36,567
to be the one
being pursued for once.

263
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:38,933
- But you made me feel
terrible about myself!

264
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:40,300
You just kept rejecting me.

265
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,533
How could you
do that to somebody?

266
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:45,267
- What?

267
00:12:45,267 --> 00:12:49,367
- You had me convinced
I was a fat, ugly, old lady!

268
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:51,967
- Well,
now you know how I feel!

269
00:12:51,967 --> 00:12:54,867
You feel bad because I turned
you down, what, three times?

270
00:12:54,867 --> 00:12:57,700
Try being rejected
40 or 50 times every year

271
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,067
for the last 10 years!

272
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:00,333
How do you think that feels?

273
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,500
You're lookin'
at the president

274
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,067
of the fat, ugly,
old ladies club!

275
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:06,600
Welcome! Have a donut!

276
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,800
- There is no way
I turn you down that much.

277
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,433
And I say "yes" a lot.

278
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:13,433
- Exactly! You say yes,
and you say no.

279
00:13:13,433 --> 00:13:15,733
You're the--you're the bouncer
in front of the disco

280
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:17,467
who decides who gets in
and who doesn't.

281
00:13:17,467 --> 00:13:19,533
And for once,
it was you standin' outside.

282
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:21,200
Yeah,
and you couldn't take it.

283
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,733
Yeah,
it's cold out there, isn't it?

284
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:24,200
Standing in the rain,

285
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,800
with your bad shirt
and your acne pimples.

286
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,133
- There is no way you can
compare me turning you down

287
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:30,367
with what you did to me!

288
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:31,567
Listen, ray,
if I turn you down,

289
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:33,067
it is
because I am exhausted

290
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:34,667
from taking care
of three kids all day

291
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:37,867
and thinking of everything
that I have to do the next day.

292
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:42,100
- Still using the kids, huh?

293
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,833
- Oh, my god.

294
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,867
I can't believe I ever wanted
to have sex with you.

295
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,900
- Well, you don't have to worry,
because I'm not sure

296
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,600
the next time
you're getting sex from me.

297
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,633
- Oh, you're threatening me
with no sex?

298
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:54,700
Please.

299
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,200
- Yeah,
you will be saying please--

300
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,600
pretty please with sugar on top.

301
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,067
I'm serious.

302
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:03,433
I don't know when
I'll be in the mood again.

303
00:14:03,433 --> 00:14:05,367
- You are always in the mood.

304
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:07,200
You wouldn't last a night.

305
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,567
- I just did three nights,
lady pantaloons.

306
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:13,900
Okay?
So we'll see who can't last.

307
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,200
- [Southern accent]
Oh, my.

308
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,900
How will I ever
resist my baser instincts?

309
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,467
- Yeah, I like that.

310
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:20,867
I like the southern thing.

311
00:14:20,867 --> 00:14:22,600
That'll be good
when you come back saying,

312
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,067
[southern accent] "Pretty please
with sugar on top."

313
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,767

[groans]

315
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:11,067
Oh, my god,
are those silk?

316
00:15:11,067 --> 00:15:13,600
- I believe they're satin.

317
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,333
You want to feel?

318
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,267
- That's quite all right.

319
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:25,600
- What's with
all your Lacy apparel?

320
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,867
- Nothing.

321
00:15:26,867 --> 00:15:28,233
It's just pajamas.

322
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,800
Good night.

323
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,500
- Yeah.

324
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,567
Yeah, yeah,
I'm a little tired too.

[Groans]

326
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:09,567
- Did you put oil on?

327
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:11,067
- No.

328
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:14,200
It's just my natural juices.

329
00:16:37,633 --> 00:16:39,767
- What are you doing?

330
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:41,433
- Me?

331
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,967
What, did you have my mom
put your makeup on?

332
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:48,267
- No sex for you!

333
00:16:48,267 --> 00:16:52,767
- No sex for you.

[Jazzy lounge music]

335
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,067
All right, you win!

336
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,933
- What?
- I give up!

337
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:18,433
I am officially
asking you

338
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:21,800
to please
have some sex with me.

339
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,633
- What are you talking about?

340
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:26,933
- Our thing.
Our not having sex thing.

341
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:28,700
- Are we still doing that?

342
00:18:32,533 --> 00:18:34,367
- Of course
we're still doing it.

343
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,967
It's been 26 days
of doing it--

344
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:37,567
not doing it.

345
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:40,733
- I'm sorry.
I totally forgot.

346
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,233
- Yeah, right.

347
00:18:44,233 --> 00:18:45,600
- I mean, I can't believe it,

348
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,700
but really,
I totally forgot.

349
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,233
- Please.

350
00:18:49,233 --> 00:18:51,633
You expect me to believe that
you didn't realize that we--

351
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:55,067
we went 26 days
without having sex?

352

I've been really busy.

00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:02,500
You know, the pta fund-raiser
is coming up,

354
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,433
and I've just had
a lot on my mind.

355
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,900
- 26 days.

356
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,733
You weren't even trying.

357
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:21,733
Guess I was never really close
to havin' the power, was I?

358
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:23,533
- Sorry.

359
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:28,333
- All this time,
I-I thought you were doin'

360
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,700
all those little things
to torture me.

361
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,067
- What things?

362
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:34,533
- Forget it.

363
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:36,067
- No, come on.

364
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:37,700
- You know.

365
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,867
Like bite your lower lip

366
00:19:38,867 --> 00:19:40,800
when you use the remote
to change the channel.

367
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,567
- I do that?
- Yeah!

368
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:45,267
Or how about
when you keep one of your legs

369
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,433
outside of the covers
and the pajama rides up it?

370
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:50,500
- It's just because I'm hot.

371
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,600
- Yes, you are!

372
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,367
Even when you sleep,
every so often,

373
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:57,800
you kind of sigh a little.

374
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,367
[Sighs quietly]

375
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,367
- You haven't
slept much lately, have you?

376
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,533
- No.

377
00:20:05,533 --> 00:20:07,033
Even now.

378
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:08,767
Look at you.

379
00:20:08,767 --> 00:20:11,033
With your hair like that,

380
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:13,700
sittin' there in your...

381
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,600
Robe.

382
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:19,900
- I'm a mess.

383
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,100
- Yeah, well, I guess
even when you're not tryin',

384
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,000
it still works.

385
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:32,800
- What? What are you doin'?

386
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,633
- You just got
a little of your power back.

387
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:38,167
- [Laughs]

388
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:40,933
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

389
00:20:40,933 --> 00:20:44,000
Are you toying with me?

390
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,500
Because if you are,

391
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,333
I'm just gonna
start to cry.

392
00:20:50,567 --> 00:20:52,900
- I've been waiting for this
for a long time, too, ray.

393
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,733
And by the way,
it's been 27 days, not 26.

394
00:20:56,733 --> 00:21:03,067
- Ah, you do re--

395
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:04,867
--member!
- [Laughs]

396
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:07,867
- Morning.
- Morning.

397
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:12,067
- Morning, kids.
- What are you doin' here?

398
00:21:12,067 --> 00:21:15,167
- We live here.

399
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:17,200
- No, no, no, no, no!

400
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,067
Hey, you guys can
make breakfast yourself, right?

401
00:21:19,067 --> 00:21:22,300
'Cause daddy has to talk to
mommy upstairs about something.

402
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,633
- Ray.
- Yeah?

403
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:29,133
[Mumbles weakly]
