1
00:00:02,267 --> 00:00:04,833
- Aha.
[Door opens]

2
00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:06,633
- Hi, ray.
- Oh, hey.

3
00:00:08,267 --> 00:00:09,900
- Oh, Deb's not here;
She's out with the kids,

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,733
so I'm just...You know,
trying to make the best of it.

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,300
- Yeah.

6
00:00:18,867 --> 00:00:21,000
- Oh...oh, okay.

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,467
Yeah, I'm just gonna
watch the knick game,

8
00:00:24,467 --> 00:00:26,133
you know, and...

9
00:00:26,133 --> 00:00:27,800
Nothing else.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,567
- Great; Yeah, Robert called
and told me

11
00:00:29,567 --> 00:00:31,067
you guys were gonna
watch the game

12
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:32,533
when he got home from work,

13
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,133
so I thought I'd wait
for him over here.

14
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:37,567
Is that okay?
- Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah.

15
00:00:40,533 --> 00:00:44,233
So when did Robert say
he was gonna come home?

16
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:46,767
- About an hour.

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,200
Are you excited about
fondue date night?

18
00:00:59,967 --> 00:01:03,167
- What--what--what what?

19
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:05,367
- You guys are coming over
tomorrow night

20
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:08,400
for Amy's first annual
fondue night.

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,600
It's gonna be just
the three barone couples,

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,833
like a triple date.

23
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:14,367
- Hey...

24
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:17,700
Hey, a date with my parents.

25
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,200
- I know you think it's corny,
but it'll be fun, really.

26
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,200
Fondue date night.
- Yeah.

27
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,067
Yeah, fun.

28
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:27,133
You know what?

29
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:28,700
I'll talk to Robert about it

30
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,100
when he gets here
in 58 minutes.

31
00:01:33,633 --> 00:01:35,200
- Oh, may I?

32
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,700
- Oh. Oh, yeah.
- Thanks.

33
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,700
Oh, look, this one
looks like a heart.

34
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:54,633
So from now on,

35
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:57,100
that's where I'm buying
all my sweaters.

36
00:01:58,167 --> 00:02:00,000
- Hey!
- Hey, hey, there he is!

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,200
There he is!

38
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,800
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hello, there.

39
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,533
- Missed you.
- Yeah, what's up?

40
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:07,167
We've been waiting
an hour and 11 minutes.

41
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,933
- Amy, ma wanted me
to remind you that

42
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:11,933
you'll be making the salad
for the dinner tonight.

43
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:14,100
- Oh, I forgot.
I better go.

44
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,767
Darn.
- Yeah, damn it.

45
00:02:17,767 --> 00:02:19,133
- See you later, yogi.

46
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:24,600
And, ray, I'll see you
at fondue.

47
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,933
- Okay, yeah.

48
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:29,100
- She's such a cutie pie.

49
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,267
[Both groan]

50
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:32,067
Oh, it's
the second half already?

51
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:34,567
- Yeah, man, you're missing
some great basketball.

52
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,533
Actually, I kind of
missed some too.

53
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:42,867
I was--me and Amy,
we had a nice long...

54
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:45,667
Chat.

55
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:47,200
- All right,
that's really nice.

56
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,700
What did you guys
talk about?

57
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,033
- Oh, gosh, pretty much
everything, I think, yeah.

58
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:53,633
- Yeah, Amy's great, huh?

59
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:57,033
- Yeah, Amy's great.
She's great. Yeah.

60
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,767
Kind of like
a little lady chatterley.

61
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:07,100
- Lady chatterley?
- Yeah.

62
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,033
- What do you mean?

63
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:10,333
- Oh, you know,
like she always--

64
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,433
she always wants to know
how everybody is,

65
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:15,900
and she gets real excited
about fondue date night.

66
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,733
And she told me about
this interesting salesgirl

67
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:21,400
that sold her a sweater
and--and--and, you know,

68
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,133
whatever; It's all good stuff;
It's all good.

69
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:28,067
- Are you saying that
Amy talks too much?

70
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,467
- No, Robert, I love Amy.

71
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:39,100
- Wow, are you a liar.

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,433
You know,
I know what it is.

73
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:45,067
I got something good,
and you can't stand it.

74
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:46,300
You never could.

75
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,500
Remember when
I made that diorama

76
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,533
in Mr. Carolan's
history class?

77
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:50,733
- What?

78
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:53,300
- Everybody said
how great it was, everybody!

79
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,100
I won a prize, remember?

80
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,733
But you said it stunk.

81
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:01,767
- You had George Washington
fighting a dinosaur.

82
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:04,600
- It was a dragon, Raymond!

83
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:10,267
A dragon that represented
years of British tyranny!

84
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:13,133
Which just goes to show

85
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:15,133
how stupid you were
then and now.

86
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:16,400
- Robert, I didn't--

87
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,800
- everybody thinks
my wife is great.

88
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,133
Everybody!

89
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,067
So you have to tell me that
she's a lady chatterbox

90
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:27,367
who won't shut up?

91
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,800
I know how it goes.

92
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,200
Jealous ass.

93
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,767
- Come on--

94
00:04:34,767 --> 00:04:37,000
- jeal-ass!

95
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,433
Yes!

96
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:41,500
- Stop it! No!
Come on, don't go, Robert!

97
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,400
Stay! Come stay
and watch the game!

98
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,733
Come on.

99
00:04:45,733 --> 00:04:47,767
You want to say something bad
about my wife, you can!

100
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:50,100
I don't care!

101
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,633
Ah, come on!

102
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:53,767
Say it! Say it!

103
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:56,733
She's a bad cook,
and she's mean!

104
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:01,667
Hey, hi...One second,
one second.

105
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:03,700
And you may
think that, Robert.

106
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,467
You'd be dead wrong!

107
00:05:05,467 --> 00:05:07,600
Dead wrong!

108
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,133
Debra is a caring,
beautiful, skinny person!

109
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,433
So how's it going?

110
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:28,600
Look, I saved you this chip.
It looks like a heart.

111
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,367
- Hi, honey.

112
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:44,300
- Hey.

113
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,967
- You've been quiet all night.

114
00:05:45,967 --> 00:05:47,200
Are you okay?

115
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,233
- Yeah, I'm fine.

116
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:49,267
Everything okay with you?

117
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:51,400
- Fine and dandy.

118
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,033
- Ooh, did I show you
this sweater I got?

119
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,633
- It's nice.

120
00:05:58,633 --> 00:06:00,267
- The salesgirl
I bought it from, brigid,

121
00:06:00,267 --> 00:06:02,000
she was so sweet and smart.

122
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,500
She's taking some time off
of school to make some money,

123
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,833
but I really hope
she finishes,

124
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,200
because she's really great--

125
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,633
- and then you
bought the sweater; Got it.

126
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:13,300
I'm sorry.

127
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,267
Actually, you know,
I kind of did have a bad day.

128
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:18,267
- Oh? What happened?

129
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:21,300
- Oh, nothing;
It's just like every other day,

130
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,567
dealing with
the scum of the earth.

131
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:29,467
- Well, at least
you get tomorrow off.

132
00:06:29,467 --> 00:06:32,567
And then, hey,
fondue date night.

133
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:35,333
That'll be fun...

134
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,467
Due!

135
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:41,533
- Yeah, you know,
I was thinking,

136
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:45,033
maybe fondue date night is not
such a good idea right now.

137
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:46,533
- Really?

138
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:48,533
Everybody else is
excited about it, even ray.

139
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:52,133
- Amy, why do you
even bother with him?

140
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:54,067
- I know he doesn't
like to open up,

141
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:56,400
but little by little,

142
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,467
I think
I'm cracking his shell.

143
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,033
And you know what?

144
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:05,433
There's a sweet person
inside.

145
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:08,167
Oh, listen...

146
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:10,900
I know you and Raymond
have had your problems--

147
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,133
- he said you talk too much!

148
00:07:15,733 --> 00:07:19,067
- What?

149
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:22,433
- He called you
lady blabbermouth.

150
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,400
- He did?

151
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,467
- Look, Amy, I'm sorry.

152
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:33,467
I've known Raymond
for a long time, and...

153
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:37,333
Do you know
what a jeal-ass is?

154
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:42,600
- Now that I think about it,

155
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,300
while we were talking
this afternoon,

156
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,133
he did excuse himself
to go to the bathroom,

157
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,433
like, five times.

158
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:51,800
I thought he had
a tummy problem.

159
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,133
- It's not his tummy.

160
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:56,967
He has no soul.

161
00:07:56,967 --> 00:07:59,767
- So he just wanted me
to go away?

162
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:05,133
That is kind of...

163
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,133
Jerky.

164
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,433
- I love you so much.

165
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:18,367
But hey, you know,
this is good.

166
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:21,300
Tomorrow night,
more cheese for us.

167
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,633
- No, no, everybody's coming.

168
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:26,700
I'm just not gonna let
Ray's opinion affect me.

169
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,767
- Okay, good, good.

170
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:31,300
Hey, you know what?

171
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,233
Don't even talk to him.

172
00:08:33,233 --> 00:08:36,167
In fact,
just stay quiet all night.

173
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:39,900
We won't even give him a chance
to think that way about you.

174
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,033
Huh?

175
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:51,367
- Robert...

176
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:55,067
When I was just
telling you my sweater story,

177
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:58,033
and you told me to...

178
00:09:00,433 --> 00:09:03,900
Was that because you
think I talk too much?

179
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,267
- No, no.

180
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:08,567
That's because
Raymond brought it up,

181
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:10,767
you know, and I didn't want him
to think that he was right.

182
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:14,600
'Cause you know,
like you said, "jerky."

183
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:17,133
And I love this new sweater.

184
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:18,900
It's a great sweater.

185
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,933
Great story about
the sweater.

186
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:23,667
I'm stealing that story!

187
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:27,933
Okay, w-w-wait,
Amy, Amy. Wait.

188
00:09:27,933 --> 00:09:31,733
Amy!

189
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:33,433
[Door closes]

190
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:36,500
The one time I get a word in.

191
00:09:43,867 --> 00:09:46,833
- Okay, we have two
different kinds of cheeses,

192
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,600
and the chocolate
is for all the fruit.

193
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,667
- Move it, lady,
I'm going in.

194
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,833
- Hello.

195
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,333
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

196
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:59,700
- Oh, Amy, everything
smells great.

197
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,933
- That's what I said.

198
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:04,633
- Marie, here is the garlic
toast I made for dipping.

199
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:06,233
- Oh, thank you.

200
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:07,700
- Hey, man.

201
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:12,800
Listen...again,
about before...

202
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,433
I'm sorry.

203
00:10:14,433 --> 00:10:16,567
- Oh, you don't have to
apologize to me.

204
00:10:16,567 --> 00:10:19,167
- Ray, can I talk to you
for a second?

205
00:10:30,267 --> 00:10:32,900
- 'Sup, sis?

206
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,167
- Listen, ray,
Robert told me

207
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,467
about what happened
yesterday,

208
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:38,867
and I just want to
let you know that...

209
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:40,300
You're right.

210
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,533
I should have realized
you're just a guy,

211
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:45,533
and guys just want
to relax and watch TV,

212
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:47,333
and I should have
left you alone.

213
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,033
- Amy, will you marry me?

214
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,467
- You know, listen, Amy--
- oh, no, no, ray.

215
00:10:59,467 --> 00:11:01,267
I don't want things
to be weird between us,

216
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:02,933
so I'm sorry.

217
00:11:02,933 --> 00:11:06,467
- Oh, well...

218
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:08,367
Me too.

219
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,633
- Great.
Let's sit and eat.

220
00:11:10,633 --> 00:11:11,567
- Okay, all right.

221
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:15,033
I don't mind if I "fon-do."

222
00:11:17,733 --> 00:11:19,767
I got a cheese one.

223
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:21,500
- Wait a minute!

224
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:26,800
That's it?
- It's fine, Robert.

225
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,433
- Let me get this straight.

226
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:32,000
Raymond insults you,
but you get mad at me,

227
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,167
and then you apologize to him?

228
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:37,000
What, are you taking
lessons from my mom?

229
00:11:37,933 --> 00:11:41,300
Who I love?

230
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:46,000
- What's going on?

231
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,600
- I'll tell you
what's going on.

232
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,167
Yesterday, poor Raymond
had to watch a basketball game

233
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,733
while Amy dared
to sit next to him.

234
00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:53,667
And then the minute she leaves,
he tells me that

235
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:55,400
she had the nerve
to talk to him

236
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,233
about things
that didn't interest him!

237
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:59,167
Called her boxy chatterhead!

238
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:01,700
- Ray!
- Raymond!

239
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,200
Why would you call Amy
a boxy chatterhead?

240
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,967
- It's lady chatterley!
It's from a book!

241
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:11,033
- You know, it's okay.

242
00:12:11,033 --> 00:12:13,233
To be fair,
ray is a sports writer.

243
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,500
It's kind of like I was
bothering him at work.

244
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:20,000
- Oh, Amy, no.
Ray doesn't work.

245
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,367
Ray, apologize to Amy
right now.

246
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,233
- Excuse me, this is
between me and Amy,

247
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:26,733
and we're fine with it.

248
00:12:26,733 --> 00:12:29,400
Amy, kudos on the fondue.

249
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:37,333
- This is not between
you and Amy.

250
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,767
What, are you kidding me?

251
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:40,167
You never listen, ever!

252
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:41,667
- Never, ever!

253
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:44,367
- Oh, don't try to
lay it all on ray, Robert.

254
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:46,000
Last night,
you made it very clear

255
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
that you think
I talk too much.

256
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Oh, dude.

257
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:56,667
- You're the one
who should be in trouble!

258
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:58,100
- Yeah, ray!

259
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,867
- You know,
you wouldn't think it,

260
00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:03,300
but this chocolate and salami
is a great combo.

261
00:13:08,367 --> 00:13:11,533
- All right,
let's all just relax.

262
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:13,300
I think we're making
too big of a deal of this.

263
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,833
- No, Amy, I have been
putting up with this

264
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,233
for 15 years.

265
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:17,533
I am not gonna let him
do this to you too.

266
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:19,433
You know, when I need
to talk to ray

267
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:22,267
about my feelings
or our children,

268
00:13:22,267 --> 00:13:24,467
I know I have until
the commercial's over.

269
00:13:24,467 --> 00:13:26,400
That gives me 30 seconds.

270
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,267
And if there's a girl
in the commercial

271
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:29,600
or a truck with big wheels

272
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,767
or, god forbid,
a monkey, forget it!

273
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:39,800
- Come on, that's not true.

274
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,900
- Look, ray, we're not
asking for that much.

275
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,700
It's just talking
and listening--watch.

276
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,733
Hello, Robert.
- Oh, hello there, Debra.

277
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:48,667
- How's it going?
- Not so good.

278
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:53,233
I've got a brother who lacks
even rudimentary social skills.

279
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:54,733
- I'm sorry to hear that.

280
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,100
- Well, thanks for asking.

281
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,833
And by the way,
those are lovely earrings.

282
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:01,200
- See?
- Yeah.

283
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,333
- Oh, that was very good!

284
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:07,067
Raymond,
do it with me now.

285
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:10,100
Hello, Raymond.
- Hello, mother.

286
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,433
Oh, look, mom,
a bear in pants.

287
00:14:15,467 --> 00:14:17,433
- Yes, your brother
is quite hairy.

288
00:14:17,433 --> 00:14:20,067
- No, ma, he's not
doing it right.

289
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,333
- Yes, yes, he is, ma.
He's also ugly.

290
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:25,400
He should really wear
a welder's mask.

291
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,600
- Why don't I weld
your mouth to your ass

292
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,400
and make a doughnut
out of you?

293
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,533
- You don't even know
how to weld!

294
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:32,333
- I'm a damn fine welder!

295
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,733
- Oh, you stink at everything!

296
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:35,567
[Both shouting]

297
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:37,500
- Do not fight!

298
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,933
This is nothing
to fight about!

299
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:42,600
- Ray, just apologize
to Amy.

300
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,500
- No, it's okay.

301
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,367
We already talked about it.

302
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:47,200
And now it just seems
like everybody's using it

303
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,533
as an excuse to attack him.

304
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:50,367
- Yeah, yeah, that's right!

305
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,033
These jackals, they pounce
as soon as they smell blood.

306
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:54,500
They love it
when I'm miserable.

307
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,267
For all I know, you guys
have been sending her in

308
00:14:56,267 --> 00:14:58,000
every day on purpose
just to annoy me.

309
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:08,200
- Oh, Amy.

310
00:15:11,733 --> 00:15:14,733
- Even I know
you got to go in there.

311
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,567
- Hey.

312
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,700
Wh-what are you doing?

313
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:40,167
- Just having some cookies.

314
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:45,600
- Listen, I didn't mean
what I said in there, really.

315
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
I was just--you know,
I'm mad at those guys,

316
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,500
and I'm sorry.

317
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:54,000
- It's okay. I'm fine.

318
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,167
- Listen, you definitely have
a right to be mad at me.

319
00:15:58,167 --> 00:15:59,400
- Oh, I do?

320
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,100
I do? Well, thank you
very much, ray.

321
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,633
- You're welcome.

322
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:07,367
- Let me tell you
something, mister.

323
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:10,433
You are a frustrating person!

324
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:12,533
All this time, I've been
trying to talk to you,

325
00:16:12,533 --> 00:16:14,733
and it's like I'm banging
my head against the wall!

326
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:16,433
I keep thinking,
"what's wrong with me?

327
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,200
Why can't I
get through to him?"

328
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,433
And now I realize that
maybe it's not my fault.

329
00:16:20,433 --> 00:16:22,500
Maybe it's just that
you're boring!

330
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,767
- [Gasps]

331
00:16:28,767 --> 00:16:31,100
- You know, Debra says
you're like this

332
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,033
because you
don't want to talk.

333
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:37,200
But I think maybe it's because
you've got nothing to say!

334
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:39,933
- I do too have stuff to say.

335
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:41,333
- Oh, yeah? Go ahead.

336
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,033
- What do you mean?
- Come on, talk!

337
00:16:44,033 --> 00:16:45,933
Come on, talk!
Right now!

338
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:50,600
And I want something more than
hot dogs and football kicking!

339
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,000
- [Mumbles]

340
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,367
- Oh, interesting conversation!

341
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:57,333
What else do you have to say,
Mr. Fascinating?

342
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,467
- This is a lot of pressure!

343
00:16:59,467 --> 00:17:02,367
- That's what I thought.

344
00:17:09,067 --> 00:17:10,600
I'm sorry.

345
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,767
I didn't mean it.
I was just lashing out.

346
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:15,133
Oh, I stink at this.

347
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:16,767
I was just trying
to hurt your feelings.

348
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:19,533
- Good job.

349
00:17:19,533 --> 00:17:22,167
- You want a tissue?
- I'm not crying!

350
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,300
- Look, ray...

351
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,267
I know I try too hard...

352
00:17:30,267 --> 00:17:33,200
Talking about
emotions and stuff.

353
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,433
It's just that
I want to be close

354
00:17:35,433 --> 00:17:37,767
to everyone in this family.

355
00:17:39,133 --> 00:17:41,300
- Why?

356
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:49,033
- Because I love you guys.

357
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,433
But I mean,
for gosh sakes,

358
00:17:51,433 --> 00:17:53,767
I know frank
better than I know you--

359
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:58,700
all his sights
and sounds and smells.

360
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,233
But at least I know
he's comfortable with me.

361
00:18:01,233 --> 00:18:03,833
I feel closer to him now.

362
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:07,000
- Yeah, don't get too close.

363
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,300
We lost a canary once.

364
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,933
- You're always so funny.

365
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:14,800
You know what?

366
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,200
It's taken some time,

367
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,667
but even Robert
has started opening up to me.

368
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:20,200
Like, he finally told me

369
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,200
why he sleeps with
a tennis racket under his bed.

370
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,033
- He still does that?

371
00:18:25,033 --> 00:18:26,900
- For the burglars.

372
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,200
- That's what
he told you it's for?

373
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,200
No, no, no, that's...

374
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,400
That's his ghost swatter.

375
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,500
- What?
- Yes! Yes!

376
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,267
Ever since we were kids,
he would--listen to this.

377
00:18:41,267 --> 00:18:43,367
One time, he was about 12,

378
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:45,300
and he thought he heard
something in the attic.

379
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,767
And so of course,
I'm making fun of him.

380
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:48,433
So to prove
that he's not scared,

381
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:50,833
he went up there
with his "ghost swatter,"

382
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,500
so I took a broom and I went,
"boom, boom, boom,"

383
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,400
and all of a sudden,
two giant legs

384
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,467
come crashing through
the ceiling--boom!

385
00:18:58,467 --> 00:18:59,700
- Just his legs?

386
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,067
- Yeah, well, he fell
on a beam--"aah!"

387
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,800
And it's just two giant legs
just sticking there,

388
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,267
and they were still
trying to run--"aah!"

389
00:19:11,267 --> 00:19:12,800
- Was he injured?

390
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,533
- Well, you tell me.

391
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,567
- Oh, ray!
[Laughs]

392
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,400
- Amy, is everything okay?

393
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,367
- Yeah, everything's
fine, Robert.

394
00:19:25,367 --> 00:19:27,367
Amy and I,
we were just talking.

395
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:30,333
- Yeah, we were.
Ray: Uh-huh.

396
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,600
- Oh, great.
Well, that's very nice.

397
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,467
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

398
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:38,400
Oh, please, by all means,
don't let me interrupt.

399
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,567
Why aren't you talking?

400
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,533
What were you talking about?

401
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:54,467
- Nothing.
Shut up, really.

402
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:56,067
- What were you
talking about, Amy?

403
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:59,567
- Fondue date night.

404
00:20:06,367 --> 00:20:08,433
- Was this about me?
What did you tell him?

405
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:10,300
You told him stuff about me?
What did you say?

406
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,700
- Nothing, Robert.

407
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,900
- He got stuff out of you.
I know him!

408
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,233
- Robert, we were just--

409
00:20:15,233 --> 00:20:16,867
- hey, come on, Amy,
we should get in there.

410
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:18,700
Dad's probably got
the fondue pot on his head

411
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,000
like winnie the pooh.

412
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,267
- Yeah, come on, Robert.
I'm hungry.

413
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:22,833
- Wait, wait, wait!
Don't lie to me!

414
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,200
Is this about how I eat my foods
in alphabetical order?

415
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,767
Because I have
a very good reason for that!

416
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:31,367
- I didn't know you do that.
- I don't!

417
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,133
Amy, I don't want you
talking to him.

418
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:37,400
Did you tell him
about my pedicures?

419
00:20:38,433 --> 00:20:41,500
- No, Robert.
- [Gasps]

420
00:20:46,767 --> 00:20:49,567
Ray: Robert paints
his feet like a lady!

421
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:54,100
Frank: Holy crap!

422
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:02,167
- This commercial's funny.

423
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:05,500
Right, watch.
Watch what the cat does.

424
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,133
[Both laughing]

425
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:09,433
- He high-fives a dog.
That's funny.

426
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:13,133
Those two don't
usually get along.

427
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:16,000
- Why don't you just
sleep with him already?

428
00:21:25,733 --> 00:21:28,433
- I've been sitting here
all night too, you know.

429
00:21:35,467 --> 00:21:38,033
- Oh look, this one's
got a monkey in it.
